    "content": "\n<p>Our June episode of Discourse!, featuring episode host Benjamin P. Marcus, Jade Hui, and Lauren Horn Griffin, covers religion and the news in the United States and Hong Kong. Kicking off the discussion with current issues of religion and the U.S. Supreme Court, they explore notions of religion, history, tradition, and authority in Justice Alito&#8217;s leaked draft decision in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#8217;s Health Organization, </em>and consider what the Court&#8217;s recent decision in <em>Carson v. Makin</em> might reveal to us about American assumptions vis-à-vis religion, the secular, and religious freedom. They conclude by discussing grieving rituals and performance art that occurred on the streets of Hong Kong on June 4th, 2022. Their discussion of religion in Hong Kong surfaces many of the same questions about history, tradition, authority, and the value of placing discussions about religion in one country in an international context.

    "content": "\n<p>In this episode, Dan Gorman and Jason Ānanda Josephson Storm follow up on their 2018 conversation for the RSP. The topic is Storm&#8217;s book <em>Metamodernism: The Future of Theory</em> (University of Chicago Press, 2021). Storm shifts away from the deconstructive and genealogical approach to religion that he pursued in his earlier books <em>The Invention of Religion in Japan</em> and <em>The Myth of Disenchantment</em>. Although Storm finds great value in the critical theories known in the United States as &#8220;postmodernism,&#8221; he is concerned that postmodernism has led to an intellectual dead end. Humanities scholars can get caught in an infinite cycle of questioning the assumptions of their academic fields. Knowing anything with any degree of certainty seems impossible. Storm argues that scholars should engage in self-reflection and critique, but they must not give up on the pursuit of knowledge. We can learn about the world, even if our subjectivity and the limits of language prevent us from achieving truly objective knowledge. This metamodern mentality balances critique with investigation, emphasizes the process of knowledge-making over static categories or terms, encourages a healthy but moderate skepticism (Zeteticism), and situates human-made signs as part of the larger natural world (hylosemiotics). Join the RSP on a journey down the philosophical rabbit hole.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The musical excerpt at the beginning of the episode is from Stephen Sondheim&#8217;s <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>.

Based on more than a decade of fieldwork during and after Trinidad declared a state of emergency in 2011, Crosson explores how religion in Trinidad took to the streets to demand justice in the face of brutal governmental crackdowns against protestors crying out against rampant police brutality. Many marching the streets believed that if the legal justice system could not deliver justice for those wrongfully killed by the police, then perhaps obeah could. Using Trinidadian spiritual workers’ own descriptions of their religious practice—<em>obeah</em>—as “science” and “experiments with power,” Crosson examines how these spiritual workers unsettle the moral and racial foundations of Western categories of religion.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Throughout the entirety of WWII and the Cold War, U.S. intelligence agencies invested an immense amount of resources into the &#8220;religious approach&#8221; to information gathering and distribution. Beginning with the leadership of William Donovan, the OSS and CIA implemented these religion-focused initiatives with the assistance of Orientalist scholarship, such as the World Religions Paradigm. Imperial Japan, Colonial Vietnam, Soviet Russia, and the Puppet-state of Iran all felt the impacts of these operations, often resulting in widespread propaganda, resistance, and war. In this episode, Dr. Michael Graziano and Jacob Noblett discuss the misguided strategies used by these agencies and their partners with the goal of establishing the United States as a global champion of freedom over &#8220;Atheistic&#8221; Communism.</p>\n",

Whether legalism comes through within a church community, local or federal judicial and legislative bodies, or nationalistic rhetoric, the stories we review all deal with the small details that make a big difference, and of course considers power and who gets to decide which details count, and why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Watch the video episode here:</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Devil is in the Details! | Discourse!

This roundtable brings together a few of those scholars, in the wake of the Spiritual Abuse conference at the University of Chester, and a series of online seminars for INFORM. Join host Theo Wildcroft and panelists Wendy Dossett, Dawn Llewellyn, Suzanne Newcombe, and Lisa Oakley as they discuss the difficulties and opportunities of such events, where they might develop next, interdisciplinary boundaries, and the limits of professional commitments to justice.

    "content": "\n<p>In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the “psychedelic renaissance” for the development of medical psychotherapy and spiritual growth in countries of the global north. From alternative therapy centers in the USA and Canada, to tourist retreats in the Amazon, and spiritual communities in Europe, psychedelics have taken a new breath of life for the past 20 years in each of these locations. Their current popularity is due to the surprising results they achieve in the betterment of mental health disorders and personal fulfillment. Thus, plants and substances like the San Pedro cactus, psilocybin mushrooms, cannabis, LSD, MDMA, and more prominently, ayahuasca, have become “magic bullets” of sorts, all-powerful solutions to all-pervasive problems of the western world. Unfortunately, critical issues related to their consumption are lost from sight in the face of the enthusiasm and amazement of their effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, psychedelic substances, i.e., substances that enable powerful bodily and visionary experiences, have been used in different societies across the world, and for a wider array of purposes than the previously described. For instance, indigenous peoples of the Peruvian rainforest like the Awajún, Huni Kuin, or Matsigenka ritually consume ayahuasca for purposes of divination, rite of passage, bolstering of social bonds, healing, exercise and countering witchcraft, etc. Thus, a key question comes forward, why does such a gap of emphasis exist between the purposes that arise in western contexts and the ones from other societies? Moreover, in the case of ayahuasca, why the particular concoction of the ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis Caapi) and the Chacruna plant (Psychotria viridis) has become so salient in the contemporary psychedelic landscape, despite being one of the possible plant admixtures among the many that indigenous people use?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Sidney Castillo talks with Dr. Bernd Brabec de Mori and Dr. Olivia Marcus about their respective research on critical approaches for studying ayahuasca. Both have carried out ethnographic research in the Peruvian amazon in different settings; Brabec de Mori with the Shipibo of the Ucayali region, and Marcus among the mestizo populations of Tarapoto and Iquitos. Their critical discussion elaborates on the meanings and motivations for the indigenous and mestizo people to use ayahuasca, framing into context the major socio-cultural processes that allowed for it to be discovered, spread, and “rediscovered” in recent times. In this sense, they address issues of inequality, power relations, ownership, and reciprocity that lie at the core of ayahuasca consumption in the Peruvian Amazon. In consequence, they discuss what would decolonize our approaches to ayahuasca entail, if this is a possibility at all, and what would be the course of action for this to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode results from the workshop “From Ritual to Justice: Towards a Decolonial and Feminist Approach to Ayahuasca”, organized by Olivia Marcus and Silvia Mesturini. It was part of the Society for the Anthropology of Lowland South America (SALSA) XIII Biennial Conference, June 21-June 25 and June 28-July 2, 2021. Hosted virtually by the University of Virginia due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n",

Before discussing the monograph, Boyarin outlines how Judaism is commonly defined in religious studies, as well as the potential problems with those definitions, particularly with regard to the sometimes competing conceptualisations of Judaism as a &#8216;religion&#8217; or a &#8216;culture&#8217;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boyarin highlights the importance of memory and memorialisation as deeply-rooted elements of Jewish practice, especially of moments of genocide and massacre such as the Shoah, which subtly addresses notions of the World Religions Paradigm discussed in previous episodes. Boyarin also argues against “religifying” studies of Jewish texts and instead emphasises both the ideas of inclusivity inherent in the Talmud and its broader applicability, regardless of the religiosity of the reader, in order to fully encapsulate all the life forms and practices that exist in the Jewish community. To bring the conversation to a close, Fallon asks of the humour in the Talmud and Boyarin’s favourite comical moments in the text.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Need a preview?

    "title": "When Christians Meet Each Other: The Saint Thomas Christians of Southwest India in the Early Modern Period",
    "content": "\n<p>Christianity is one of the most ubiquitous religions in the world. In reality, it would be more plausible to rather speak about Christianities given the wide variety that can be found adapted to different contexts, languages, and histories. In this sense, its own internal diversity makes it most pervasive and enduring despite the passage of time or cultural boundaries. But it is worth asking, what happens when Christians from different sides of the world, apparently, meet each other for the first time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this week’s episode, RSP associate editor Sidney Castillo talks with Dr. István Perczel who presents a highly detailed history of the Saint Thomas Christians (or Syrian Christians) of Kerala, a religious group that has been present in Southwestern India since late antiquity. His discovery of a corpus of Syriac manuscripts from their archives in 1998, has allowed for a turning point in the current understanding of the colonial relations, religious disputes, and overall historiography of the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the takeaways of the episode is how the discovery of new sources allows for further outline the cultural environment in which such texts are produced. Among the many sources, some of them refer to theological debates regarding mystical conceptions of God, and which were translated and re-read from Syriac, to Malayalam, and to Latin. The translation avatars of these documents, and the discussions that arose from figures such as Jesuit priest Francisco Roz, and Nestorian priest Mar Abraham, show the dynamism of the Syrian Christian community during the early modern period. Such “cultural wars” and disputes for truth narratives are certainly no strange to us in our present time, especially when looking at them through the lens of colonialism, political polarization, or cultural appropriation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Need a preview?

They cover early grassroots movements such as the Anti-Masonic Party and the Know Nothings, who sought to fight against what they perceived as a threat to Christian values from a New World Order. This is paralleled to QAnon and current theories which hold a similar distrust of the government, the media and beliefs of a Satanic New World Order. We then move to discuss The John Birch Society and how their form of improvisational conspiracism linked to contemporary right-wing mobilisation and the Christian Identity Organisation. Threaded throughout our discussion, we ask explore the motivations for joining such a movement and what keeps people there despite moving targets and failed prophecies.

Savannah chats with Dr. O&#8217;Donnell about their interest in rhetoric around demons and how that interest translated into their first monograph, <em>Passing Orders: Demonology and Sovereignty in American Spiritual Warfare</em> (Fordham University Press, 2021). The two also discuss Dr. O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s methodology, the importance of including interdisciplinary perspectives in religious studies projects, and discourse analysis as a theoretical framework. We wrap up our conversation with a discussion about what it means to engage in the &#8220;critical study of religion&#8221; from multiple perspectives and how Dr. O&#8217;Donnell sees their work fitting in—or not—to this larger project. What&#8217;s next for Dr. O&#8217;Donnell? Tune in and find out!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Need a preview?

    "content": "\n<p>Indigenous peoples have history. Though this fact might not pervade the collective imaginary in different countries, recognizing it is crucial for understanding the social processes that have shaped the current struggles indigenous peoples face in South America. In this direction, the sub-field that has contributed the most is ethnohistory, through the register of ritual practices, life cycle events, and the general way of life of an indigenous group in a given time in history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Boris Briones talks to RSP interviewer Sidney Castillo about his comparative research on the Mapuche and Selk’nam people of austral South America. His work delves into the indigenous religions of both groups, located in the southern regions of Chile and Argentina, where he did extensive archival research to reconstruct their history, beliefs, and practices, some of which are still present to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An important point raised through the conversation is that these indigenous peoples have become systematically ostracized and exterminated by the state in both countries, resulting in the ethnocide of the Selk’nam, and the continuous marginalization of the Mapuche. Given this context, scholarly inquiry of this kind is of greater importance due to its potential for cultural, social, and political vindication in their respective countries. But this impact does not limit itself to academia, as Briones himself has carried out several initiatives for reaching to the general public in an effort to provide basic literacy on these matters. Such endeavor highlights the importance of moving beyond the ivory tower for supporting current struggles related to religion and indigenous peoples, a responsibility that we owe to the very people that aid us in our research in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Need a preview?

How are we to explain the resilience of this Islamic state when conventional wisdom seems to suggest it should have been an impossible project from its outset? Noah Salomon&#8217;s ethnography of the Islamic state in Sudan provides a window into the making of a modern Islamic state by focusing our attention on the Sudanese people that not only constitute it, but bring it to life through their poetry, spiritual devotions, and everyday lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Need a preview?

Yearly the community celebrates San Paolino di Nola with a festival that culminates with the carrying of the giglio — a seventy-foot (21m) tall, four-ton tower. In her analysis, masculinity, devotion, and even Catholicism itself are made through labor and the process of &#8220;doing the work&#8221; from counting money to painting statues, getting tattoos, or lifting the giglio.

What happens when we honor individuals whose v<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/the-rocket-behind-margaret-court-s-ac-20210126-p56wzz.html\">iews on sexuality, marriage equality, and gender are deeply controversial</a>? Moving to the motorways, the second news item involves the demolishing of sacred Indigenous trees to accommodate a freeway expansion. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-54700074\">This ongoing story</a> reveals deep divides between stakeholders over the environment and Australia&#8217;s cultural heritage laws. Finally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/05/victoria-bans-gay-conversion-practices-after-12-hour-debate\">in the most recent news piece</a>, the group discusses legislation banning gay-conversion therapies in the Australian state of Victoria. In this instance, the bill explicitly names and bans religiously-informed conversion practices. Bringing the three items together, the episode turns to the notion of human rights as a significant thread running between all stories.</p>\n",

As a historian of modern America, Dr. Stahl focuses on pluralism in American society by examining how politics, law, and religion interact in spaces such as the military and medicine. Her first book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/314gygp\">Enlisting Faith: How the Military Chaplaincy Shaped Religion and State in Modern America </a>(Harvard University Press, 2017), traces the uneven processes through which the military struggled with, encouraged, and regulated religious pluralism over the twentieth century. Just as the state relied on religion to sanction war and sanctify death, so too did religious groups seek recognition and legitimacy as American faiths. The chaplaincy incorporated new religious groups slowly, especially because blurred religious and racial categories confounded a military invested in racial segregation. Indeed, opening the chaplaincy to more faiths was neither accidental nor fully envisioned; rather, it emerged over decades of war through a combination of incremental decisions made by government officials and agitation from civilians. Hence war and military service placed chaplains at the center of debates that defined modern American life: questions about religious pluralism and sectarianism to be sure, but also racial justice and gender equality, imperial ambitions and global obligations, state-perpetrated violence and death, sexuality and family life, and, finally, legal rights and educational opportunities.</p>\n",

Focusing on the idea of &#8220;contraceptive nationalism,&#8221; Goodwin argues that allegations and instances of sex abuse have been used as markers of religious difference to present some groups as a threat to America. The projection of purity is a way we divide religions into &#8220;good,&#8221; safe traditions that align with normalized American understanding of sex and &#8220;bad,&#8221; dangerous traditions whose ideas about sex fall outside the mainstream. Though we <em>know</em> sex abuse is a real problem endemic to all societies, Goodwin&#8217;s work reminds us that sex scandals have serious rhetorical and discursive power in the U.S. and have played important roles in American cultural narratives that contribute to the marginalization of already vulnerable religious communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more we heartily recommend Goodwin&#8217;s Book, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eErKrY\">Abusing Religion</a></em>.</p>\n",

Second, our “imperfect tools for making sense of&#8230; objects of devotion” led him to consider the role of aesthetics and the complex histories of devotional materials, especially before and after the impact of colonialism. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen in to their conversation as they consider the limits of theological or religious agendas that encourage scholars to ask who controls our understanding of objects like the mahmal (a ceremonial palanquin used in the Hajj) when they resist neat models of signification? </p>\n",

Listen and find out!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First the groups speaks on some of the differences in major news publications and their coverage of environmental issues. Opening with the broader issue of how such stories appear (or do not) in major news outlets, Suzanne Owen offers some discourse analysis. Who is covering environmental issues so regularly their masthead categories reflect that attention? This is a moment to acknowledge how some political affiliations on both the left and the right can make it harder to sell stories about both religion and the environment.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite those challenges, one issue pushing that intersection of politics, religion, <em>and</em> the environment into the front pages is the election of the United States&#8217; second Catholic President, Joe Biden. Dan Gorman cites<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/us/biden-catholic-christian.html\"> Elizabeth Dias&#8217; article in the New York Times</a>, &#8220;In Catholic Faith, an Ascendant Liberal Christianity,&#8221; as one place we&#8217;re seeing coverage of the role of Catholic environmentalism being discussed openly.    </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such issues of identity and politics lead the group to talk about the ongoing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/narendra-modi-new-delhi-india-coronavirus-pandemic-3f25e11535359288e461761027fb1b68\">Farmers&#8217; Protests in India</a> (and the twitterstorm involving Rihanna and Greta Thunberg). Noting that the location of the striking workers is predominantly Sikh, the group looks to larger issues of religious and national identity under President Narendra Modi. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Dan suggests that <a href=\"https://grist.org/fix/how-one-womans-big-bold-idea-is-making-climate-a-moral-issue-for-jews/\">the Big Bold Jewish Climate Fest</a> is one place where we can see significant attention being drawn to the union of environmental and religious activism.

Anna Gade&#8217;s work,&nbsp;<em>Muslim Environmentalisms</em>&nbsp;reframes this area, both critiquing and building upon the tools of religious studies (RS) and environmental humanities (EH). Religious studies, for its part, has privileged Jewish and Christian understandings of key ideas such as nature and wilderness. This bias has left the field less capable of responding to the rising need for studies about efforts globally by many religious groups to address climate crises. EH has also suffered from this overreliance, and Gade&#8217;s work identifying the different approaches toward the environment of her Indonesian Muslim interlocutors is a critical step forward. Interviewed by Lauren Osborne and David McConeghy, this episode discusses the challenges this interdisciplinary work faces and shares some of the reasons why the inclusion of Muslim perspectives into the broader conversation about religion and the environment is so desperately needed today.</p>\n",

Cusack has published widely on the topic including her 2011 monograph <em>The Sacred Tree: Ancient and Medieval Manifestations</em> (Cambridge Scholars Publishing) and a recent special volume of the <em>Journal of Religion and Nature</em> edited by Cusack. Beginning with Cusack&#8217;s journey to studying the sacred tree, the conversation turns to specific examples of the Fortingall Yew and Glastonbury Thorn, both of which connect to Christianity. Turning to contemporary examples, Fallon and Cusack discuss the 2020 destruction of the Djab Wurrung tree in Australia.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Professor Eddie S. Glaude Jr.&#8217;s new book,&nbsp;<em>Begin Again: James Baldwin&#8217;s America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own</em>,&nbsp;pulls few punches. It begins with and dwells deeply on what Baldwin, a towering mid-20th century American literary figure, called the &#8220;lie at the heart of America.&#8221; The lie is the value gap &#8212; the ways America has elevated the worth of white lives over those of people in other racialized groups. Baldwin&#8217;s unfettered honesty about this lie, explains Dr. Glaude, means that we have a chance to imagine a world that is otherwise. Just as Baldwin went abroad as an &#8220;elsewhere&#8221; from which to renew and sustain his critique of American identity, today Dr. Glaude urges us to begin again. We can, he argues, &#8220;choose to be better. We need only build a world where that choice can be made with relative ease.&#8221; The choice to see things differently confronts the hard truths America hides from itself, especially those which are bound up in the origin stories Americans tell ourselves about who we are and where we have come from. To see those truths as Baldwin did means the opportunity to begin again, starting with recognizing past hurts and ongoing harms without letting go of the promise of redemption or even salvation that follows. On this 2020 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, please enjoy this timely and critical discussion about race and religion in the U.S.</p>\n",

The conversation turns to the impact of this abuse on the survivor&#8217;s religious experience, a topic she has written on in her article &#8220;Soul Murder&#8221; (2018). In discussing the impact on faith, Dr. McPhillips highlights the impact of the commission&#8217;s findings on the broader religious community, where many experienced the shaking of faith foundations due to the central position of religious institutions in the creation of their worldview. The episode ends with Dr. McPhillips sharing her critically important pilot podcast series, <em><a href=\"https://anchor.fm/university-of-newcastle5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Survivor Story Podcast</a></em>, which explores the experiences of 5 survivors of church-based institutional child sexual abuse in the Newcastle-Maitland diocese. </p>\n",

Among these, one of the area studies that first emerged was Jewish studies, which focuses on the study of Judaism and Jewish communities throughout the world in different historical times. And while it is certainly important to study Jewish history on its own terms, this can hardly be done without observing the cultural context in which that history developed and took form.</p>\n<p>In this week’s podcast, Dr. Carsten Wilke talks to Sidney Castillo about the different processes that Judaism and Jewish identities underwent throughout modern European history. Wilke first briefly presents the scope of research of Jewish studies and then outlines how Jewish identity, belief, and community have been shaped by elements of local culture in Europe and beyond.</p>\n<p>To further delve into this relationship, Wilke discusses the topic of his presentation at the international conference “Imperial Mysticisms: Piety and Power in Early Modern Empires from a Global Perspective” held at Central European University last November 2019. There he analyzed how the spread and development of modern Kabbalah corresponded with the migration of Sephardic Jews from Iberian empires (Portuguese and Spanish) to Ottoman Palestine.</p>\n<p>No doubt this podcast will spark interest in those who are studying/researching in area studies, mysticism, or early modern history, and are actively looking for ways of problematizing their own scope of research.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>The study of religion has been dominated by two approaches to religious change: the secularisation thesis, and the &#8220;lived religion&#8221; paradigm. They form a contradictory pair, one stressing decline, and the other stressing innovation. One stresses reason, the other stresses experience &#8211; yet both center on the individual as the &#8220;source&#8221; of religion. What would a post-humanist model of religion and society look like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This question is at the core of Paul-Francois Tremlett&#8217;s new book, <em>Towards a New Theory of Religion and Social Change: Sovereignties and Disruptions</em>. Drawing from scholars including Deleuze and Guattari, Jane Bennett, and Bruno Latour, Tremlett argues for an approach to religious and social worlds that does not begin with immutable things like religion, class, society, or the self, but instead prioritises flux, dialectic, and transformation. This is a new model that rejects both the teleology of modernity and the heroic individual.</p>\n",

    "title": "Ancient Christian Origins: A Heterogeneous History",
    "content": "\n<p>The question of the origins of ancient Christianity has puzzled believers and skeptics alike. For the first, the history of Christianity is the anchor point for claims of authenticity.  For the second, a search for origins opens religious traditions to questions about their contingency and <em>sui generis </em>status. So the perspectives most often speak past each other, both sides internalizing their structure of authority and creating logics of practice to sustain themselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this week’s episode, the RSP’s Sidney Castillo talks with Professor William Arnal of the University of Regina about his research on ancient Christian origins. First, Prof. Arnal uses the perspective of Religious Studies to interrogate the question of origins. He points out how this field differs from theology and how it attempts to demystify religious phenomena. This bracketing of the miraculous and supernatural is of special relevance today, since many scholars (certainly in the past  and some still even today) have regarded Christianity as <em>sui generis</em> either in kind, origin, or truth.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of the conversation is directed towards the discussion of the Gospel of Thomas and the Q, two important New Testament sources that, through Arnal’s sharp contextualization, help reveal the diverse social contexts of early communities that saw themselves as followers of Jesus. Prof. Arnal argues that one of the main causes for the emergence of these early communities and their discourses related to salvation and denial of this world come was because they faced great social change. From the expansion of the Roman Empire in the 1st century to the 2nd century, we see greater and more deliberate use of  “Christian” identities alongside growing traditions and practices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arnal concludes that we can “put to bed” the historical Jesus once and for all, as it is less valuable for scholars to debate the accuracy or authenticity of our sources as many scholars have done. We should, rather, find what insights are available to us to show how the people of the time related to the discourse of a folk hero. What agency was gained by becoming a Christian in this era? What social and economic privileges might be gained or lost?  Reconfiguring our approach to early Christianity shifts our focus on this era towards religious studies and the tools we have to study social phenomenon and away from the desire to use historicity or authenticity as a cover for older understandings of the purpose of our field&#8217;s efforts. </p>\n",

An expert in environmental, agricultural, and food ethics, Dr. Van Wieren shares her research on small farms run by religious communities. Such farms, whether in Upstate New York or Michigan, have changed their traditional practices in order to directly address ethical and environmental concerns. Dr. Van Wieran shows the way climate activism has often been a concern for religiously-connected farms, but current events make this a more pressing concern today than ever before. Can large scale agricultural productions learn from the adaptations of their smaller, religious competitors? Those teaching undergraduate courses on Christian, Jewish, or Muslim groups will also find this conversation a source of practical advice for integrating the current climate crisis into our religious studies curriculums. </p>\n",

Newton explains the success of Haley&#8217;s best-selling novel about the life of Kunta Kinte and his descendants and the novel&#8217;s place in the canonical narrative of America for both Black and White Americans. By examining Roots as a piece of scripture, Newton illustrates the grounding power of the book&#8217;s narrative &#8212; a wellspring of theology and culture for Americans for almost fifty years.  Following an anthropological approach to the study of scripture more broadly, Newton sees the function of scripture as multiple, relying on diverse meanings of the root of the terms, uproot, and route. Drawing attention to Roots as a scriptural text that plays an active role in both power and identity politics, the discussion concludes by turning to the Black Lives Matters movement and the recent use of Haley&#8217;s <em>Roots</em> by American politicians.</p>\n",

Working in areas of art history, Buddhist Studies, anthropology, and cultural studies, the panelists shed light on some of the challenges and promises of working within and across disciplines. Topics range from “ritual” as a critical scholarly term, interdisciplinary contributions to the field of ritual studies, issues of ritual change, and current challenges (and benefits) to international and interdisciplinary work during the current global health crisis. Overall, this conversation reveals the complex interplay between research demands, institutional support, field-wide assumptions, and technological challenges that shape the way scholarship on ritual is produced. Listen now for a glimpse of how interdisciplinary approaches can help widen the scope of academic work in each of these areas and improve the way scholars approach the study of Buddhist rituals.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Cotter begins by providing an overview of previous literature in the area, highlighting the common missteps in the study of non-religion within the Religious Studies academy. Here, Cotter illuminates how he directly responded to those missteps via the creation of his specific methodology, bringing together locality and discourse analysis to create a critical lens for the study of non-religion. Looking specifically at Southside Edinburgh, Cotter highlights some of his findings before turning to the usefulness of his methodology outside of the study of non-religion. Finishing on a candid note, Fallon and Cotter discuss both the positive and negative academic relationships that influenced the creation of this book, bringing their discussion of the intellectual-journey in the creation of this publication full-circle.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>&#8220;Decades of work is all of a sudden viable and possible in the blink of an eye,&#8221; says CU Boulder Professor Natalie Avalos in the final moments of her conversation with RSP Co-Host David McConeghy. After last season&#8217;s conversation with Malory Nye that highlighted the colonialism and racism embedded in the European roots of the field of religious studies and its earliest forefathers, we continue this season with the perspective of a scholar of religion positioned within Ethnic Studies and Native American and Indigenous Studies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her work on modern, urban Indians in New Mexico, Dr. Avalos highlights the need for theories that center the lived experiences and ontological realities of her interlocutors. These do not come from white Europeans writing a century or more ago. To uncritically retain these relics of our field&#8217;s past is to be complicit in perpetuating their structural and psychological harm as components of colonialism. It makes us complicit in that legacy&#8217;s ongoing trauma, so how do we break this cycle? What has changed that makes this work &#8220;viable and possible&#8221; today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Avalos shows us a way forward, one rooted in decolonial theories like regeneration that not only express Indigenous epistemologies, but also <a href=\"https://rsn.aarweb.org/spotlight-on/teaching/anti-racism/decolonial-approaches\">create moments of deep reflection for our students</a>. She urges us to do more to make visible our hidden relations to structures of power. This is the work of  decolonizing religious studies. If we aspire to produce transformative work &#8212; including teaching and scholarship that changes how we think and improves our lives &#8212; then we need to start with ourselves and the work we can each do peeling back the layers of our own complicity in sustaining colonialism&#8217;s vestiges. That&#8217;s the challenge of forging a more just and more rewarding path for our field&#8217;s future. </p>\n",

Our podcasts with, for example, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-naomi-goldenberg-on-religion-as-vestigial-states/\">Naomi Goldenberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-james-cox-on-the-world-religions-paradigm/\">James Cox</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/1-the-problem-with-religion-and-related-categories/\">Tim Fitzgerald</a>, demonstrate that ‘religion’ is a distorting anachronism with roots in European colonial exploitation that has been utilized to justify the cultural superiority of Christian Europe, and is at base ‘a citation of Christianity as idealized prototype’ (Goldenberg 2018: 80). But what might it mean to decolonize the study of religion? How can we take this well-rehearsed critique and put it into practice?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this podcast, Chris is joined by Malory Nye to discuss the decolonizing project. Why is it necessary? Should we speak of decolonizing rather than decolonization? How can the field address its whiteness, and its colonial origins and legacy? What are the theoretical, methodological, historical and pedagogical challenges that this might entail? How can ‘we’ ensure that this is a thorough decolonizing project and not merely a nod to neoliberal higher education agendas? And what can those of us who have limited time and resources at our disposal do to address this urgent and thoroughly pervasive problem with the study of religion? These questions and more animate this broad-ranging discussion with the author of<em> Religion: The Basics</em>, and two key journal articles – “<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/mtsr/31/3/article-p210_2.xml?language=en\">Race and religion: postcolonial formations of power and whiteness</a>” and “<a href=\"https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.421/\">Decolonizing the Study of Religion</a>”.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n<hr>",

Beginning with the approaches of late 19th century anthropologists like E.B. Tylor, Modern discusses how prayer became an object of study for social scientists. As they tried to find out whether &#8216;prayer works,&#8217; researchers proposed a constellation of theoretical models and experiments that treated religion as a discrete object. Measuring prayer made it easier to use religion and its practices as tools or instruments available for commodification and capitalization. In this wide ranging episode, Modern sketches a few of the bio-political effects that can be seen from his genealogical approach, and he shares with listeners how the American rock band DEVO merits our attention as a surprising fusion of scientific and religious perspectives.</p>\n",

Amid mass protests against police brutality and systemic racism ongoing in the United States right now, the guests highlight the story of Martin Gugino, a 75-year-old member of the Catholic Worker Movement who was injured protesting, as well as President Trump&#8217;s much derided photo opportunity in response to those protests. The conversation then pivots to recent reports that invoke threats of the apocalypse, including the Trump administration decision to consider resuming explosive testing of nuclear weapons.

Speaking on Holocaust museums specifically, Alba highlights the tensions between Jewish ritual and religious practices with the secular notion of a museum. In particular, questions of theodicy, the role of the Holocaust museum in the mourning process, and the centrality of education play a key role in her analysis. This podcast highlights the complex nature of ritual and religion in the experience of public places of history, as well as the liminality of such purpose-built sites of commemoration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>In this episode, Dr. Maxinne Connolly-Panagopolus asks Dr. Ullrich Relebogilwe Kleinhempel how we might better understand and engage with South African Shamanism and Mysticism. Beginning with<em> Sangomas</em> or spiritual mediators, Dr. Kleinhempel introduces some of the types of Shaman which exist in the South African context such as the herbalist, who learns mystical powers from plants; the diviner, who uses oracles such as bones as objects for mediumship; and the seer, who relies on inspiration from dreams, telepathy and intuition. Turning to the complex configuration of race, heritage, and culture present in South Africa, the conversation moves to a discussion of&nbsp;&nbsp;white <em>Sangomas</em>, and how these individuals are perceived by their community. Finally, within the region&#8217;s diverse religious landscape, Kleinhempel shares how <em>Sangomas</em> sometimes navigate multiple religious identities. Listen in for a discussion that encourages scholars to reflect on how they will negotiate the demands of critical inquiry alongside their own personal experiences or competing worldviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on Sangoma, Umbanda, and other specific elements of this conversation, please consider the following resources:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Hall, J.

    "content": "\n<p>In San Diego at the 2019 American Academy of Religion&#8217;s annual meeting, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/david-mcconeghy/\">Dave McConeghy</a> sat down with six early career scholars to discuss religious literacy in the context of the release of the AAR&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.aarweb.org/AARMBR/Publications-and-News-/Guides-and-Best-Practices-/Teaching-and-Learning-/AAR-Religious-Literacy-Guidelines.aspx?WebsiteKey=61d76dfc-e7fe-4820-a0ca-1f792d24c06e\">Religious Literacy Guidelines</a>. The guidelines were a multi-year project funded by a grant from the <a href=\"https://www.avdf.org/\">Arthur Vining Davis Foundation</a>, and speak not only to the needs of teachers in higher education like the panelists in this roundtable, but also more broadly to primary school education in the U.S. &nbsp;The panelists gathered here represent significant voices in the next wave of changes to religious studies programs, where market pressures mean we must think deliberately about how to position religious studies within the academy to advance our field and its work. Among the central questions explored in this episode, perhaps the most fundamental is this: What is the role of our teaching and scholarly contexts on the way we approach religious literacy? If one-size cannot fit all, then what is different about religious literacy when it comes to a public versus a private college? What is the impact of teaching to a regional versus national student body? How do the varied missions expressed by our universities encourage or limit our dialogue with the critical theoretical wings of our discipline? Join us for a lively conversation with <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/richard-newton/\">Richard Newton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/chris-jones/\">Chris Jones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/rebekka-king/\">Rebekka King</a>, <a

The processes or projects of secularization, says Thomas, were instrument of American empire. By looking at the ways discourses about religious freedom regulated race, gender, and ritual practices in occupation-era Japan, we can see the double-standard of what America has advocated for abroad versus practiced at home. Thomas calls for deeper scholarly engagement with the category of &#8220;freedom&#8221; and how freedom of religious expression has been racially coded as white in the United States. It is a cautionary tale with important pedagogical and institutional lessons. If we find that discussing &#8220;diversity looks like activism,&#8221; he suggests, then &#8220;we have a huge problem&#8221; that reveals why diversity in the academy is essential for discussing secularism, religious freedom, and religion today.</p>\n",

After the release of Star Wars film in 1977, it became obvious that creator George Lucas had tapped into something profound. Over the next few decades, Star Wars became a behemoth worth billions of dollars and a multi-media franchise spanning film, television, video games, comic books, novels, theme parks, toys, and much more. Since 2012, the RSP has touched on Star Wars many times, most often in discussions of invented, fictional, or hyper-real religions. Enjoy the selections from six different episodes as we learn why this franchise and other popular cultural institutions are important sites for the production of identity and the construction of the category of religion.</p>\n<p>To hear the original recordings, please visit the following episodes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/artificial-intelligence-and-religion/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Episode 321: Artificial Intelligence and Religion</span></a> &#8212; Christopher Cotter interviews Beth Singler (February 2020)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/slenderman-and-online-mythology/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Episode 281: Slenderman and Online Mythology</span></a> &#8212; Ross Downing interviews Vivian Asimos (February 2019)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/hyper-real-religion-digital-capitalism-and-the-pygmalion-effect/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Episode 235: Hyper-Real Religion, Digital Capitalism and the Pygmalion Effect</span></a> &#8212; Sammy Bishop interviews Adam Possamai (November 2017)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/categorising-religion-from-case-studies-to-methodology/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Episode 190: Categorising Religion from Case Studies to Methodology</span></a> &#8212; Breann Fallon interviews Teemu Taira (September 2016)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-markus-davidsen-on-fiction-based-religions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Episode 12: Fiction-based Religions</span></a> &#8212; Christopher Cotter interviews Markus Davidsen (April 2012)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-carole-cusack-on-invented-religions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Episode 3: Invented Religions</span></a> &#8212; David G Roberston interviews Carole Cusack (January 2012)</li>\n</ul>",

To what degree are boxer&#8217;s religious affiliations only as skin deep as their tattoos? What are the goals for boxers looking to integrate their personal narratives of religious conversion as elements of their professional identity? What are the different stakes for audiences or communities with longstanding support for the sport? In this moment of social distancing, please enjoy this moment of reflection on the intersections of sport and religion. No matter what sport you may find yourself a fan of, we hope that you can soon return to playing and watching it soon.</p>\n",

    "title": "Near Death Experiences",
    "content": "\n<p>Accounts of Near Death Experiences will no doubt be very familiar to listeners of the RSP and the broader public. From fictional accounts such as the <em>Wizard of Oz</em> or <em>Flatliners</em>, to self-reports which grew in popularity in the mid-twentieth century, many of us will be know narrative tropes such as the tunnel, the life review, and the out of body experience. Existing research has tended to, on the one hand, focus on the pathological elements of Near Death Narratives – attempting to ‘explain away’ the phenomenon in reductionistic terms – or, on the other hand, view such accounts as substantive proof of a ‘world beyond’. In today&#8217;s podcast, we showcase an approach which accepts reports of Near Death Experiences as discourse, and attempts to understand them in their social, cultural, and historical context. Further, we ask what is the relationship between these narratives and contemporary discourse on ‘religion’? Joining <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/christopher-r-cotter/\">Chris Cotter</a> in this podcast is Professor Jens Schlieter, who has admirably addressed these questions and more in his recent book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G4FGB5S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\"><em>What Is It Like To Be Dead? Near-Death Experiences, Christianity, and the Occult</em></a> (OUP 2018).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we discuss definitions of Near Death Experiences, how one might study reports of such experiences from a critical study of religion perspective, how such reports are related to modern societal developments such as ‘secularization’, individualization, and advances in medical science, as well as the impact of ‘religious’ meta-cultures upon these reports and the potential ‘religious’ functions they appear to serve.</p>\n",

Should we really see these traditions as “anti-image”? This episode charts some of the major moves taking place in the volume, especially the presumption of the normative stance of aniconism in the study of these traditions. What if we turn instead to the aesthetic regimes of the religious traditions in question by&nbsp; considering their shared habitus or the methods of &#8220;seeing&#8221;used by their members? Such a shift reveals the political nature of debates over images, and the power of iconoclasm. Referring to specific case studies from the volume, the conversation offers ideas about re-imagining and challenging the assumption by scholars that practitioners of religious traditions such as Islam, Judaism, or Christianity hold a contemptuous view of images. Perhaps an increased focus on aesthetic regimes rather than images can provide a superior way to analyze and select data for this area of religious studies.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Norman Lear was a central figure in American television in the 1970s. His media productions like <em>All in the Family </em>were deeply activist, reflecting his ideas about what kinds of dialogue and reflection were needed to preserve American society in an era of sharp divisions over social and political issues that came to be called the Culture Wars. As a voice for progressivism and liberalism, Lear articulated a powerful vision of the public square where civility was the shared root for multicultural America. In this conversation, Dr. Benji Rolsky frames the public square as the central discursive space for mid 20th century liberals, one which not only gave them great social leverage but also limited their future strategic options to respond to the emergence of the religious right as a consolidated political block starting with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.</p>\n",

In these works, thinking about the historical development of the category “religion” leads to consideration of other ‘modern’ categories which make up the colonial epistemé. If religion is deconstructed, where does that leave the other categories that use or rely on it? What happens to its common opposites like “the secular”, “science”, “liberalism” or even “politics”?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fitzgerald argues that this mutually-dependent signalling system largely emerged in the late 17th century.&nbsp; As rhetorical terms expressing specific class interests and aspirations in concrete situations of power, this system of signals originated in the context of the ancient regimes and sacred Monarchies of Christian Europe. Since then, each category has been continually contested, with shifting and unstable meanings. Now they have become so capacious and universalised that they have no clear boundaries, and we cannot properly distinguish between them. Yet these ideas have, over time and through repetition, become normalised and neutralised such that they appear as common sense. Today they form the basic categories for the organisation of our institutions, including academia and universities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen to the first part of David G. Robertson&#8217;s interview with Timothy Fitzgerald on&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ideology-Religious-Studies-Timothy-Fitzgerald/dp/0195167694/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=ideology+of+religious+studies&amp;qid=1584303397&amp;sr=8-1\">The Ideology of Religious Studies</a>&nbsp;</em>here: Episode 322 <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/1-the-problem-with-religion-and-related-categories/\">&#8220;The Problem with &#8216;Religion&#8217; and Related Categories&#8221;</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Beliefs are not written in stone. They change over time and sometimes we hold contradictory beliefs. Taking beliefs as changing and nuanced rather than fixed reveals the role of narratives and cultural context in shaping beliefs.&nbsp; In this week’s episode, Sidney Castillo&#8217;s conversation with Ülo Valk introduces us to some of the ways in which this process occurs in the form of vernacular religion. Focusing on the personal nature of these changes, Valk sees beliefs as fluid, which problematizes the stability of other categories such as knowledge and truth. Especially when we express beliefs as narratives, we change the way we understand the world. Valk&#8217;s research in Mayong, a village in northeast India, shows how beliefs about the use of magic, divination, gods, and mantras, allow for personalized and open-ended cultural traditions ripe for innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This podcast was recorded and produced in the context of the 17th Annual Conference of the European Association for the Study of Religions (EASR), “Religion &#8211; Continuations and Disruptions” held in Tartu, June 25 to June 29, 2019. We kindly thank the EASR Committee and the University of Tartu scientific committee, organising team, and volunteers for the support provided during this process.</p>\n",

In this interview &#8211; the first of a two-part retrospective &#8211; we discuss his career and how his studies in Hinduism and his time spent in Japan led him to question the relationship of categories like caste and ritual to the broader category &#8216;religion&#8217;. His realisation was that religion is such a broad category that it can include almost everything. We discuss the historical development of the category, and its roots in Protestant theological ideas, and the political movements of the eighteenth century.

Sidney raised the very recent congress elections in Peru (held on January 26) and the role Christianity and New Religious Movements have on voting. Sierra brought to the table a novel which is receiving much media attention, perhaps not for the right reason, Jeanine Cummins&#8217; <em>American Dirt</em>. Cummins accepted a seven-figure sum for this book on the immigrant experience. Both the book and the American publishing industry at large have received negative attention for their lack of Latino representation and the homogenising of both Latino and immigrant narratives. Using this as a springboard, Sierra, Sidney, and Breann discuss notion of diversity in the Religious Studies publishing world as well as the prominence of &#8220;American-civil-religion&#8221; stabilising narratives in the American literature and entertainment scene.</p>\n",

These contributors bring a broad range of expertise and experience to the discussion, with work focusing upon online and digital spaces, the built environment, art, literature, broadcast media, social media, podcasting, and more.

    "content": "\n<p>The United States Supreme Court will hear arguments in a key religious freedom case, Espinoza v. Department of Revenue, in January 2020. In that case, the Court will decide whether a taxpayer-funded scholarship program can, even indirectly, fund a private religious school. The case has ignited a debate about no-aid clauses to religion in state constitutions and, more broadly, the separation of church and state. But is it possible ever truly to separate church and state? And how do courts decide what is religious&#8211;and therefore separable from government?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this podcast, noted religious liberty lawyers Maggie Garrett (Americans United for Separation of Church and State) and Jennifer Hawks (BJC) discuss the Espinoza case before diving into other pivotal, recent decisions&#8211;including Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, and Employment Division v. Smith&#8211;that raise questions about how courts define religion and religious freedom. We discuss how claims for religious exemptions offer insight into operating definitions of religion and the ways those definitions are predicated on sincerely held beliefs and/or actions (whether those actions take place within the four walls of a house of worship or beyond those walls). In other words, what do religious exemptions tell us about what counts as &#8220;truly&#8221; religious? Are beliefs alone protected? Or behaviors too? And how does a Court decide whether it has the authority to grant an exemption to a neutrally applicable rule or to forbid actions linked to sincerely held beliefs, religious or not? Along the way we discuss taxes and religion, dignitary harm, the &#8220;religious marketplace&#8221; and more.</p>\n",

Within recent conversations about the threat of humanities and liberal arts programs at many universities, the applied approach at GSU offers many benefits, not only in developing inter-university faculty and program partnerships, but also for recruiting majors and successfully showing how the skills of a religious studies degree can be vital for a student’s career aspirations.</p>\n",

However, this unnuanced stereotype takes little account of the lived realities on the ground, particularly among the constituency at focus in today’s podcast, a large group of around 860,000 ‘secular’ millennials, who have come of age during a phase of national conflict when some Palestinian and Israeli government leaders, and not just fringe figures, have utilized religio-ethnic symbols to motivate and divide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this podcast, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/christopher-r-cotter/\">Chris Cotter</a> is joined by <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/stacey-gutkowski/\">Dr Stacey Gutkowski</a> to discuss what it means to be a ‘secular Jewish Israeli millennial’.

    "content": "\n<p>Unbelief has often been defined as either ignorance or rejection of religious systems, but this week&#8217;s guests David Herbert and Josh Bullock see far more diversity in the ways one can be nonreligious. Sharing lessons from their project &#8220;Reaching for a new sense of connection? Towards a deeper understanding of the sociality of generation y non-believers in northern and Central Europe,&#8221; we hear about a more nuanced phenomenon of unbelief, where a diverse array of positions are constantly anchored, defined, and recreated in social settings. Collected from nationwide surveys, social media, and interview data, the project presents the tendencies of nonreligious young adults in the UK, Netherlands, Norway, Germany, Poland, and Romania.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the takeaways from this podcast is that unbelief has widespread national differences as reflected in analysis of social media, but regional similarities from historical contexts show the effects of wider geo-political alignments. For example, in the Netherlands, Norway, and Eastern Germany non-religious people are more likely to express no interest in religious matters, while in Poland and Romania people vocally expressed their unbelief in politicized ways.

    "title": "Doctors and Stigmatics in the 19th and 20th centuries",
    "content": "\n<p>Stigmata are a special kind of miraculous event. They involve the physical manifestation of Jesus’ wounds as depicted in the Bible Gospels. Though many people in history have claimed to bear these marks, they have also been used as proof of the existence of God or to build legitimacy for a religious community. Those who have studied stigmata include investigators from the Catholic Church, religious skeptics, and medical professionals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week&#8217;s podcast with Gabor Klaniczay focuses on the final group, doctors. In his research on stigmata during the 19th and 20th century in Europe, Klaniczay analyzes how the medical discourse has tried to establish authenticity for stigmata cases. Discourses differed based on religious affiliation with Catholic doctors were more prone to credit them as proof of the supernatural, while Protestants ones were more skeptical, often trying to attribute them to hysteria, self-suggestion, or plain forgery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the interview, Klaniczay refers to the social context in which stigmata occurred, as in the cases of Louise Lateau in 19th century Belgium and France, and Padre Pio in 20th century Italy. The first corresponded with a time of intense social change and secularization during the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune, while the second found correspondences with World War I and major processes in Italian politics. In this way, Klaniczay&#8217;s approach reflects Jesuit historian Michel de Certeau&#8217;s&nbsp; research on the 17th century Loudun Possessions: miraculous or mystical events are the language in which the symptoms of social change take form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This podcast was recorded and produced in the context of the 17th Annual Conference of the European Association for the Study of Religions (EASR), “Religion &#8211; Continuations and Disruptions” held in Tartu, June 25 to June 29, 2019. We kindly thank the EASR Committee and the University of Tartu scientific committee, organising team, and volunteers for the support provided during this process.</p>\n",
    "excerpt": "<p>In this week&#8217;s podcast with Gabor Klaniczay we learn about cases of stigmata during the 19th and 20th century in Europe, where medical discourses clashed with as well as supported religious discourses about the authenticity and meaning of famous stigmata cases like Italian Padre Pio. </p>\n",

By connecting Brazil’s colonial past to its pluralist present, Dr. Chesnut explains how folk saint culture connects the country’s diverse population of Catholic, Pentecostal, and Afro-Brazilian religious groups. Focusing on lived religious experiences, including Santa Muerte&#8217;s unofficial role in Day of the Dead in Mexico, this episode highlights the many different ways Lady Death operates for her devotees and reveals some of the ongoing challenges of studying the religion amid the rapidly changing religious landscape of the Global South today.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Conservative discourse has had many faces in Latin America. For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Catholic Church had a monopoly, but was succeeded by the charismatic evangelical movements after the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. As the Catholic Church took a more progressive turn, evangelical movements became the spokespersons for conservative views. Today, these discourses are being infused with scientific perspectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this week’s podcast, Professor Jerry Espinoza Rivera explains how historical Latin American conservatism became neoconservatism. Though Latin America is diverse, conservatism has been a constant throughout the region’s history, intervening not only in the power plays of religious institutions, but also in the shaping of people&#8217;s everyday life conceptions of the world. Through a discussion of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07TX4D736/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07TX4D736&amp;linkId=6ff3b92386a543660c60ceecfda1324e\"><em>The Black Book of the New Left: Gender Ideology or Cultural Subversion</em></a> by Argentinian authors Nicolás Marquez and Agustín Laje, Espinoza Rivera shows how neoconservatism has managed to influence these processes by developing a language of its own that blends “scientific” arguments with philosophical and historical analysis of the contemporary world political landscape. This language is popular among religious groups, including both Pentecostals, Evangelicals, and Catholics today. Paradoxically, the diverse users of this language has generated a common tongue for anyone that wants to participate in current Latin American public arenas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This podcast was recorded and produced in the context of the 17th Annual Conference of the European Association for the Study of Religions (EASR), “Religion &#8211; Continuations and Disruptions” held in Tartu, June 25 to June 29, 2019.

    "content": "\n<p>The allure of speaking on behalf of a dead personality or scholar is a constant impulse among their respective followers. Every now and then questions like “what would x think about the world we live in?” or “what did x exactly meant with this argument?” are thrown in debate rooms, the political arena, or specialized conferences on the relevance of a certain scholar. And while the answers to these questions continue to fill up edited volumes, social media feeds, or inspirational quotes for the day, the accuracy of these statements remain to be proven by the very persons who uttered them in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, we are growing closer to a solution to this conundrum with the increasing development of artificial intelligence (a.i.). In this week’s podcast, Katrine Frøkjaer Baunvig discusses preliminary results from the research project “Waking the Dead”. This project aims to build an a.i. bot of Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig (1783-1872), a Danish “secular saint” considered to be the father of modern Denmark, who contributed immensely into generating a national consciousness through his writings, both in a political and religious way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professor Baunvig explains how the research team went through by using the digitized works of Grundtvig with machine learning, into developing and algorithm and training it with the whole work corpus. Then they used word embedding to build semantic networks -a sort of conceptual blueprint for outlining Grundtvig’s worldview- and contextualized them using digitized newspapers of the time when he was alive. The expected result is to place the a.i. Grundtvig bot inside a look-alike robot that can interact with people in public settings such as the Danish National Museum by September 2022, the year of his 150th deathday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The anthropological, sociological and philosophical reflections these future interactions with the public will be of much interest once we find out what people have to say about the accuracy of thought of this “resurrected” Danish thinker, but also, what this version of “Grundtvig” has to say about the current state of affairs of Danish society, and the world overall. Regardless of the result, one thing is for sure, both sides will honor Grundtvig’s idea of the “living word”: using the spoken act of communication as the best means to convey each other’s ideas.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Religious freedom has emerged in recent years as a pivotal topic for the study of religion. It is also the subject of heated debates within many countries and among human rights advocates globally, where competing groups advance radically different ideas about how religious freedom operates and what it protects. While for marginalized and minority communities, this freedom can provide important avenues of appeal, at the same time, governing regimes of religious freedom have most often served the interests of those in power and opened up new channels of coercion by the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This conversation with Tisa Wenger, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1469634627/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1469634627&amp;linkId=df9e3984d9f6bcdffca3904a9b411bf8\">Religious Freedom: The Contested History of an American Ideal</a>, starts with the question of how religious freedom talk functions to shape the category of religion and to transform what counts as religious in the modern world. Using Wenger&#8217;s ethnographic and historical research on the Pueblo Indians, we discuss how local, national, and international regimes of religious freedom have shaped (or even produced) new religious formations, ways of being religious, norms of good vs. bad religion, or distinctions between the religious and the secular. In short, how has religious freedom (re)produced religion and its others in the modern world?</p>\n",

    "title": "Natural Selection In the Evolution of Religion",
    "content": "\n<p>Since its inception, evolutionary theory has sought to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding biological processes and their degree of influence in the ecology of the behavior of living beings. Such an approach has managed to explain how the pressure mechanism of natural selection has allowed the emergence of biological systems that exhibit social behavior (e.g. ants, dolphins, and Hominidae in general). Yet, when trying to address the ever-increasing complexity that grows within the social and cultural evolution of different societies, this explanation does not suffice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this week&#8217;s podcast, professor Armin Geertz outlines an answer elaborating on the arguments presented in his co-authored book The Emergence and Evolution of Religion by Means of Natural Selection. He argues that there are multilevel selection processes that happen within different sociocultural formations, and these are key to understanding how religion has evolved throughout history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He proposes 4 ways in which additional selection pressures occur, these are named after prominent names in the history of sociological thought: Spencerian type 1, Durkheimian, Spencerian type 2, and Marxian. Respectively, the first is related to group formation based symbolic identification, the second relates to the group competition that happens within an environmental niche, the third refers to when polities developed complex institutions capable of wide regional or global expansión, and the fourth is when in a society, there is discrimination against specific groups, which could lead to a revolution or to that group to be put down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of these, religion plays a key role in articulating, contrasting, or supporting different ways of social engagement within a society and between societies as well. Understanding these mechanisms and the way they interplay with religion allows for a complementary framework derived from natural selection towards sociocultural evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This podcast was recorded and produced in the context of the 17th Annual Conference of the European Association for the Study of Religions (EASR), “Religion &#8211; Continuations and Disruptions” held in Tartu, June 25 to June 29, 2019.

Chris is joined today by Daan Beekers to discuss spatial contestations and conversions, particularly looking at (former) church buildings in the Dutch context. We discuss some of the research projects he has been involved in, before looking at two particular case studies – the Fatih Mosque, and the Chassé Dance Studios – where Church ‘conversions’ have taken place. We discuss the various discursive entanglements surrounding these buildings, and the contested notions of heritage that come from different constituencies who are invested in their presence. Finally, we ask if there is anything necessarily ‘religious’ going on here… (Unsurprisingly, the answer is, ‘it’s complicated… but there’s nothing <em>sui generis</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listeners may be interested to check out Daan’s recent blog post, <a href=\"https://www.religiousmatters.nl/buildings-images-and-objects/article/converted-churches-matters-of-entanglement-heritage-and-home-1/\">Converted Churches: Matters of Entanglement, Heritage and Home.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are also encouraged to listen to our previous podcasts with Kim Knott on “<a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-kim-knott-on-religion-space-and-locality/\">Religion, Space and Locality</a>” and Peter Collins on “<a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-peter-collins-on-religion-and-the-built-environment/\">Religion and the Built Environment</a>.”</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>The use of source languages for the academic study of religion has had a long-standing presence in scholarly production. Especially useful in the comparative study of myth, philology has contributed in shedding light on the meaning of old texts and other written records of ancient civilizations, as well as finding linguistic convergences and contrasts among them.<br>In this week’s podcasts, Dr. Paola Corrente gives us insights in how the use of the philological approach can be beneficial for, not only providing a common and solid framework for comparative research but also, for providing more suitable ways of classification according to linguistic criteria. Her work on the “dying gods” –i.e. gods that die but come back to life– of Ancient Greece and Mesopotamia, which draws on the concept formulated by James George Frazer, provides a case for this exercise.<br>On the last segment of the interview, she opens a debate on how scholars of religion tend to reject classifications when studying religion comparatively. In this regard, she appeals tacitly to what another likeminded author has identified as “religiocentrism” (Diez de Velasco 2005), that is, the methodological bias that a researcher could have when studying other forms of religiosity or spirituality.</p>\n",

How do these “cultural languages” or “religious language” inform our pedagogical strategies in the classroom. Is cultural familiarity something to be broken immediately and displaced by new concepts and perspectives? Is it to be leveraged as devices for easy onboarding to other, more unfamiliar terms and ideas?

In this interview we discuss what is included in the book, how it got put together, and some of the broader theoretical and practical issues it deals with.

Research on nonbelief has been limited as most research focuses on the popularity of the religious “nones” or the complexities of alternative faith expressions such as spirituality. Through two studies, one qualitative and one quantitative, Dr. Christopher F. Silver&#8217;s research explored how nonbelievers’ self-identify. Study 1 (the qualitative study) discovered that individuals have shared definitional agreement but use different words to describe different types of nonbelief. Through thematic coding, a typology of six different types of nonbelief was observed. Those are Academic Atheists, Activist Atheist/Agnostics, Seeker Agnostics, Antitheists, Non-Theists, and the Ritual Atheists. Study 2 explored the empirical aspects of these types related to the Big Five Domain, Ryff Psychological Well-Being, Narcissistic Personality Inventory, Multidimensional Anger Inventory, Rokeach Dogmatism Scale, and intersections related to religious and spiritual ontology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoyed this podcast, check out Chris Silver&#8217;s podcasts about grad school and academia with &#8220;The Unlikely Academics&#8221; <a href=\"http://theunlikelyacademic.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Ray, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the execution of Dominique Ray could move forward and denied Ray&#8217;s request to have an imam at his side in the execution chamber (though a Christian chaplain could be present). This case prompted an outcry by many religious freedom advocates in the U.S. and generated a debate about the unequal application of religious freedom protections and accommodations.</p>\n<p>In South Carolina, the Trump administration&#8217;s Department of Health and Human Services granted Miracle Hill Ministries, a foster care agency, a waiver to receive federal funding despite its commitment to only place children with Protestant foster parents. We discuss how this case ties in with broader questions of judicial empathy and how we care for children in the United States.<br />\nEllen Page made headlines when she asked Chris Pratt to explain his membership in Zoe Church, an evangelical church in Los Angeles accused of promoting anti-LGBT teachings.

    "content": "\n<p>Estonia, the northernmost of the Baltic states, has a reputation of being one of the most secularized countries in Europe. Although the visibility of religion is rising, being ‘not religious’ is still considered normative. Estonia is a context in which notions and debates on religion, atheism, and indifference are interrelated in complex ways with the history of Estonian nationalism, and two foreign religious-secular regimes: German Lutheran and Soviet Atheism. In this interview, Chris and Atko Remmel discuss why the Estonian context is – or should be – interesting to scholars of ‘religion’. What happened during the Soviet era? What about the academic study of religion in Estonia? How did the strong connection between Estonian national identity and ‘atheism’ develop? How does this play out in the contemporary context?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interview was recorded at the European Association for the Study of Religions’ <a href=\"http://www.easr2018.org/\">2018 conference</a> on Multiple Religious Identities in Bern, Switzerland, and concludes by looking ahead to the 2019 EASR conference in Tartu, Estonia.</p>\n",

However, it is arguably fair to see that, in contrast to previous generations, young people born after 1990 have always lived in social and cultural environments constituted by conspicuous consumerism, digital media and the proliferation of global social movements. Despite a number of detailed, contextual studies that have emerged in recent years concerning the complex interactions between young people and the religion-related field – indeed, we would strongly recommend listeners check out our podcast with Naomi Thompson on “<a href=\"https://religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/religion-youth-and-intergenerationality/\">Religion, Youth and Intergenerationality</a>” – large-scale, international, and usefully comparable research has been lacking. Today, Chris is joined by Marcus Moberg and Sofia Sjö to discuss the fascinating “Young Adults and Religion in a Global Perspective” project, which has been addressing this dearth on a massive scale. In this interview, we discuss the logistics and some of the emerging findings of a project which has involved utilizing a number of innovative research methods – including the <a href=\"https://wheatoncollege.edu/news/wulff-explores-psychology-religion/\">Faith Q-Sort</a> – conducted simultaneously in different locations across the globe, including China, Finland, India, Israel, Japan, Ghana, Peru, Poland, Russia, Sweden, USA and Turkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interview was recorded at the European Association for the Study of Religions’ <a href=\"http://www.easr2018.org/\">2018 conference</a> on Multiple Religious Identities in Bern, Switzerland.</p>\n",

    "title": "The Therwil Affair: Handshakes in Swiss Schools",
    "content": "\n<p>In this podcast, taking place on the last day of the Annual EASR Conference in Bern, Dr Philipp Hetmanczyk and Martin Bürgin of Zurich University talk to Thomas White about the Therwil Affair, a controversy that emerged in 2016 after two Swiss Muslim schoolboys declined to shake hands with their female teacher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seemingly rather local, minor incident of two boys declining a handshake in a school just outside of Basel escalated into a major national debate, and was reported in news media across the world. As the issue moved from one of school governance, to public values, to law and later immigration, the Therwil Affair became a focal point for national discussions on religious freedom, gender equality, civic duties, multi-ethnic integration and cultural identity in Switzerland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the podcast delves into Swiss political history, Philipp and Martin elaborate on both the conservative and liberal cultural narratives which sought to situate the Muslim schoolboys’ refusal to shake hands. They comment that it is not without some irony that amongst the voices who decried the gender inequality implied in the schoolboys’ actions were the same conservative men who had previously argued against women acquiring the national vote: a policy that did not enter law on a national level until as late as 1971 – and in a specific canton as recently as 1990!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following an explanation of the historical backdrop to contemporary Swiss ‘culture wars’ that the Therwil Affair spoke so clearly to, the discussion moves to how Swiss educational law has shifted subsequent to the Therwil Affair, with schools now expected to report to Swiss Immigration similar instances of supposed integration failure. With schools being understood not merely as centres for education but also as sites for the teaching and reproduction of standardised norms and values, in countries of religious, ethnic and cultural diversity, the tricky question emerges as to what these norms and values are? Perhaps what may be better, as Philipp suggests, is for schools to resist expectations that they should be cultivating a cultural homogeneity, but focus instead on preparing pupils for moments of cultural difference.</p>\n",

The share of countries with “high” or “very high” levels of government restrictions on religious beliefs and practices rose, but the share of countries with “high” or “very high” levels of social hostilities involving religion remained stable. In total in 2016, 83 countries (42%) had high or very high levels of overall restrictions on religion – whether resulting from government actions or from hostile acts by private individuals, organizations and social groups&#8211;up from 80 (40%) in 2015 and 58 (29%) in 2007.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this podcast, we speak with Dr. Katayoun Kishi, who oversaw the ninth in a series of reports by Pew Research Center analyzing the extent to which governments and societies around the world impinge on religious beliefs and practices. We discuss the findings of the report as well as methodology for collecting and analyzing data.

    "content": "\n<p>Following on from the delivery of her conference paper at the EASR 2018 in Bern, in this podcast, Professor Marion Maddox of Macquarie University speaks to Thomas White regarding the historical, national and regional differences in the presence of religion in Australian and New Zealand schools. The podcast begins with a brief biography of Professor Maddox’s rise to academic tenure, and the various post-doctoral positions that paved her transition away from theology, and towards the subject of religion and politics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Covering projects including the training of Catholic school teachers and deputy-principals in secular religious education, her research into the Hindmarsh Island affair – which investigated Aboriginal women’s claims to ‘secret women’s business’ – and her work under the Australian Parliamentary Research Fellowship, the discussion turns to national differences between public religion in New Zealand and Australia. Contrasting Australian multi-culturalism with New Zealand bi-culturalism, Professor Maddox explains how, despite New Zealand being further along a path of secularisation (by religious affiliation), religion often obtains a greater presence in the public sphere as it is carried on a policy of cultural recognition for Maori tradition, as mandated in the country’s Treaty of Waitangi. This was particularly evident with the daily expression of Maori karakia (prayers) in her daughter’s school, which later transpired to be the Lord’s Prayer!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focusing on the Australian experience of public policy on religion and education, Maddox explains how 19th Century Australian concerns regarding both sectarianism and protecting religion from political manipulation led to a surprising consensus across colony parliaments that religion should be kept out of the public school system. In the late 20th Century, however, ‘currents of change are pulling in different directions’.</p>\n",

    "title": "RE Commission report: A Way Forward?",
    "content": "\n<p><strong>Commission on Religious Education</strong><br>The number of students being entered for the public examinations in Religious Studies in England and Wales (GCSE, at 16 and A level, at 18) fell significantly in the summer of 2018, and more than a third of schools are breaking the law by failing to provide Religious Education (RE). The decline can be explained in part by educational policy decisions, for example RE is currently excluded from the EBacc, a group of GCSE subjects which are viewed by government as a performance measure for schools. Policy decisions both reflect and feed public assessments of the value of subjects, and public support for RE is demonstrably low. Perhaps the public imagines (rightly or wrongly) that RE is aligned with religion itself, and thus the subject suffers with the same ‘toxicity’ that Linda Woodhead considers attaches to the ‘brand’ of religion. Whatever the case, confusion about the aims and purposes of the subject in schools is unlikely to support its flourishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A report published in September 2018 by the Commission on Religious Education entitled Religion and Worldviews: the Way Forward: A National Plan for Religious Education attempts to tackle these problems. Its central proposal is for a change in the law to ensure that all pupils in England, no matter what type of school they attend, receive their ‘National Entitlement’ to education about religion and worldviews. The report, authored by fourteen Commissioners from a range of sectors (including academics, teachers, headteachers and consultants, a broadcaster and a Human Rights lawyer), was the culmination of two years of intensive consultation with a range of stakeholders, and an ambitious attempt to bring the whole ‘RE Community’ together to push for statutory change. Considering the neo-liberal fragmentation of the education system over the last two decades, and the growth in the number of schools with a religious character, this attempt to achieve consensus on the core content of RE is indeed ambitious. The Commission on Religious Education’s report is not the only one published in recent months suggesting ways forward for the subject. Linda Woodhead and former Secretary of State for Education Charles Clarke, recently published A New Settlement Revised: Religion and Belief in Schools. Though the detail of their recommendations differs, both reports lobby for urgent governmental intervention to secure a place for an academically credible subject on the school curriculum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a recent RE research and policy conference #2020RE, Dr Wendy Dossett had the opportunity to chat with two of the Commissioners and authors of the Religion and Worldviews report, Dr Joyce Miller and Prof Eleanor Nesbitt, along with Religious Education sociologist (and convener of SOCREL), Céline Benoit. Their conversation ranged over some of the following issues: the rationale for the move from calling the subject ‘Religious Education’ to ‘Religion and Worldviews’; the inadequacy for the classroom of a world religions approach; the degree to which faith communities are entitled to influence what gets taught in schools; and the anomaly of the so-called withdrawal clause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listeners outside the UK context may be unfamiliar with the following terms:<br>Key Stages (introduced in the 1988 Education Reform Act) are age related periods in education: Key Stage 1 (aged 5-7), Key Stage 2 (aged 7-11), Key Stage 3 (aged 11-14), Key Stage 4 (aged 14-16), Key Stage 5, (aged 16-18).<br>SACREs: (Standing Advisory Councils for Religious Education) are statutory local education authority bodies, including representation from the Anglican Church, other Christian denominations and other faiths, teacher representatives, and elected council members. SACRES support and resource RE in all local authority schools, and every five years review the locally Agreed Syllabus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

In some cases, Muslim schools have become a safe haven, especially for women, “a place where their identity is not in question, where they can feel safe and comfortable”. Also, Dr. Jasmin Zine describes to Mariia Alekseevskaia the challenges which Canadian Muslim schools face today, including a difficulty to promote critical thinking and “the spirit of debate” while teaching about religion as well as maintaining patriarchal religious cultures.

    "content": "\n<p>Ever since the so-called ‘refugee crisis’ of 2015, the ‘refugee’ in Germany has been constructed in a variety of ways that are implicated in specific co-constitutive notions of the ‘secular’ and ‘religious’ that exert symbolic power by naturalizing certain notions of the religious and thereby the secular while excluding others and feeding back into the subject formation (or subjectivation) of people classified as ‘refugees’. In this process certain positions are produced as hegemonic while others are classified as not acceptable (e.g., “radical”, “not European” or “anti-humanist”). This in turn feeds into the on-going institutionalization of Islam in Germany. In this podcast, Chris speaks with Carmen Becker on this important topic, drawing upon her critically engaged ongoing fieldwork among Syrian forced migrants in the city of Hannover and an analysis of political measures, research designs and media productions that are part of the apparatus producing the ‘refugee’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interview was recorded at the European Association for the Study of Religions’ <a href=\"http://www.easr2018.org/\">2018 conference on Multiple Religious Identities</a> in Bern, Switzerland.

And justifiably so. Indeed, our good friend and colleague Vivian Asimos of Durham University has been producing the very interesting &#8220;Religion and Popular Culture Podcast&#8221; for a while now. But what about Religious Studies (as a field of study), and the people who do it, in popular culture? When we initially thought about this, we could certainly come up with a list of academics and &#8220;bookish&#8221; people who are somewhat problematically and wildly inaccurately portrayed in popular culture &#8211; from archaeology&#8217;s Indiana Jones and paleontology&#8217;s Ross Gellar to archivists&#8217; Rupert Giles and linguistics&#8217; Louise Banks &#8211; but we struggled to come up with many examples of the study of religion as we, here at the RSP, know it. Luckily, today&#8217;s guests have given the question much more attention! Given that popular cultural representations are more likely to shape public perceptions about what the study of religion is and who does it than either direct experience in the classroom or statistics about graduation rates and job placements, we hope that you will agree that we should try to understand what these perceptions are. In this podcast, Chris speaks with Professors Brian Collins and Kristen Tobey about this fascinating and important topic. This interview is based on a recently published article &#8211;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rsr.13420\">From Middlemarch to The Da Vinci Code: Portrayals of Religious Studies in Popular Culture</a> &#8211; a shorter version of which has been published in blog form as <a href=\"https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/casaubons-revenge-popular-representations-scholar-religion\">Casaubon&#8217;s Revenge: Popular Representations of the Scholar of Religion</a>.</p>\n",

Yet, despite this naturalistic – get it? – response, in an enormous array of contemporary and historic discourses we find nature being gendered… and, in many cases, this gender is female. Is, as Sherry Ortner once asked, Female to Nature as Male is to Culture? Where does this discourse come from? How does this gendering of nature intersect with contemporary forms of ecospirituality? And religion more generally? Why does it matter? And for whom? Joining Chris today to discuss these questions and more, is Dr Susannah Crockford of Ghent University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interview was recorded at the June 2018 EASR Conference on Multiple Religious Identities in Bern, Switzerland, where Susannah has delivered a paper entitled “What Gender is ‘Nature’?

Why attend conferences? What is the point? What else could we do instead that might be a better use of our time?

I&#8217;m Chris Cotter, and I&#8217;m joined here for an impromptu roundtable with some of my esteemed colleagues. I&#8217;m going to say, let&#8217;s go round to my right. So I&#8217;m Chris, and you should all know me, Listeners, and if you don&#8217;t, then: what are you doing? I don&#8217;t know. Who have we got here?</p>\n<p><strong>Sammy Bishop</strong> (<strong>SB</strong>): I&#8217;m <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/sammy-bishop\">Sammy Bishop</a>. I am a PhD student, based in Edinburgh, and also I&#8217;m involved with the Religious Studies Project, sometimes interviewing, sometimes helping out in other respects. And it is great to be here.</p>\n<p><strong>Angela Puca</strong> (<strong>AP</strong>): I&#8217;m <a href=\"http://research.leedstrinity.ac.uk/en/persons/angela-puca(b7e1d837-6d99-47cc-85f1-f170a03d3404).html\">Angela Puca</a> and I&#8217;m also a PhD student, but at Leeds Trinity University. And I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m here, (laughter) but I&#8217;m happy to . . .</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: We&#8217;ll find out, later. And there’s a man behind the sound desk there with a beard that is more impressive than mine!</p>\n<p><strong>Moritz Klenk</strong> (<strong>MK</strong>): You&#8217;re so kind! My name is <a href=\"http://unibe-ch.academia.edu/MoritzKlenk\">Moritz Klenk</a> and I&#8217;m also a PhD student, here – from Bern. I&#8217;m doing a PhD somewhere between Sociology of Religion, epistemology and the academic Study of Religion – or whatever the most recent name of this discipline might be. And also I&#8217;m a <a href=\"https://www.1968kritik.de/archiv-aller-episoden/\">podcaster</a>. And this is why I have built this studio for this conference. And I&#8217;m very happy to see it in such good use.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: And Listeners will really be appreciating the sexy sound quality of everything that has been coming out of this conference! Who’s the last individual?</p>\n<p><strong>Tom White</strong> (<strong>TW</strong>): And lastly . . .</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: And least . . .</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: And least – last and least – <a href=\"http://otago.academia.edu/ThomasWhite\">Tom White</a>. I&#8217;m also a PhD candidate, from the University of Otago – where it is very wintry, in the South Island of New Zealand – mostly looking at religion, law and climate change in Fiji.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: So Moritz, you&#8217;ve got us all together here, so I&#8217;m going to pass over to you to stir the pot, as it were.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Cheers. So the idea I had in mind, when thinking about making this a reality to come together for a last roundtable at this conference, was actually just . . . I would be interested in some reflections and possible criticism of the conference and what is happening here. Because every one of us, I assume, is getting used to travelling to conferences like these, telling others about his or her research. And so we are . . . . This is what we are doing. This is one part of our business. And so we, I think, can take the time to reflect a bit on what we are actually doing here. If it is the discourse we are all looking for, are we so interested in it? Or if not this, then what else do we do here? And to have a conversation. Because, at least – I&#8217;m already telling you what I was experiencing – but I think it is the most important thing you can experience, in these kinds of conferences and events, is that you get into conversations sometimes, and they are very fascinating. Sometimes you want to find your way out of them (Laughter).</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Claw your own eyes out sometimes . . .</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Yes, also that. (Laughter). But a conversation seemed to be the fitting end of that kind of event. So yes, I&#8217;m very glad that you all joined me for this and I&#8217;d be interested in your opinion about this conference. I&#8217;m a bit biased because I&#8217;m a local. So, this happens in Bern, so I shouldn&#8217;t start I guess. But maybe some of you have impressions, ideas?</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Well, my immediate reaction is that I have spent so much time podcasting! And I decided that this conference would be a chance for me to film various little bits of video and whatnot – which has been a useful experience. I think it&#8217;s really ramped up the engagement from folk who hadn&#8217;t been able to be here. But my actual impression of this particular conference has been somewhat limited, because I&#8217;ve been running around so much. I have seen something like, I don&#8217;t know, ten to fifteen papers. (<strong>5:00</strong>) But that&#8217;s not quite . . . you should normally be expecting to see maybe at least double that. So, perhaps someone who . . . . Well, Angela has been probably been the most participatory because the rest of us have been running around doing podcasts.</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: I&#8217;ve been running around from one paper to another, or from a panel to another – so still running! Yes, this was my first EASR Conference and I really enjoyed it. Maybe the only criticism I have is that all the panels on the same topic were at the same time. So it was really difficult. There were, for example, some time slots where I really wished I had the gift of ubiquity and other timeslots there was really nothing relevant to my research – of course, still interesting panels, but not quite relevant to my research. So I would have liked to attend more panels on my research, which were actually there, but at the same time as others.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: But maybe this was also the intention, in a way, to bring together scholars from different research areas and to give them, by this kind of overlap . . . . I don&#8217;t know if that was the intention. I chose to interpret it in that very friendly way. But I think, to give them a chance to look beyond their own work they&#8217;re doing; to see the broader field of the European Studies of Religion, what people are doing. This is also I think the only chance you will get, because normally you’re . . .</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: That&#8217;s a fair point, actually, I would say. Because you come to conferences and at the start of this conference I thought, “Oh. Damn. There’s about five or six different panels on the ‘nones’, the ‘secular’ and all this kind of stuff. I&#8217;m going to have to go to those.” But, equally, I&#8217;ve kind-of heard all I need to hear, perhaps . . . not all I need to hear. But if I want to approach these scholars, I can approach them; we can have dialogue anyway. But I sort-of felt I was going to have to attend them, because they were there, because I didn&#8217;t want to miss out on that key snippet. At the end of the day I actually didn&#8217;t go to that many, because of my podcasting schedule and whatnot. But I sometimes do find at a conference that it&#8217;s the panels that you go to just because it “sounds vaguely interesting, but isn&#8217;t quite connected to your research”, that you can suddenly find, actually, there&#8217;s a really good connection. And it opens up a whole new vista, in a way that you aren&#8217;t ever going to just pick up a journal article that&#8217;s just not on your topic and read it – much as we would all like to. There’s only so many hours in the day! So a conference can do that, that way. Has anyone had that sort of revelation at this one, that we a saw a paper that we didn’t really . . . that we went along to because it was in a panel with something else, or because there was nothing else in the schedule?</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: I&#8217;ve ended up going to a lot of education, or the kind-of “role of religion in schools”, “schools as ideological production sites” whereby people are being trained in citizenship, or where schools are “sites of contested religious identities”: the crucifix; the burka. And, without any intention, I&#8217;ve ended up having quite an education in religion-focussed conference – which isn&#8217;t really my discipline or my key area, but has been quite nice to move into that and become more familiar with that subject area. But, yes, I think there is a point in picking a theme and trying to go deep, rather than doing a random pick-and-mix of entire breadth of the discipline. Because it loses a certain coherency. And that coherency with the education panels, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed.</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: Just on the topic of themes as well: I was thinking about conference themes, and how this one was “multiple religious identities”. And I don&#8217;t know how many papers actually speak to that, that I&#8217;ve been to. And then, I was just kind-of wondering . . . sometimes, what the point of having a theme of the conference is. Because everyone knows that, at the EASR, you&#8217;ll go if you want to present a paper. And sometimes you can mould it to the conference theme, just for the sake of it. Sometimes there just seems like a bit of a facade, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: My one bit of input on that . . . well I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll end up having a bit more . . . ! So, I&#8217;ve been doing a history project, on the <a href=\"https://basr.ac.uk/\">British Association of the Study of Religions</a>. For a number of years, now, we&#8217;ve ended up having a conference theme. But when I went back through the record, the conferences didn&#8217;t used to have themes. (<strong>10:00</strong>) Back in the day, it was just like sort-of ten old white men gathering in effectively a living room and having a chat. There would be one paper, and that was the conference. It then expanded to two papers, one in the evening and then one the following morning. And that&#8217;s what the Association was for decades. And then, as things grew and grew, it got bigger. And then they started to have an annual lecture. But there still wasn’t a conference theme. And then what seems to have happened at some point in the mid-‘90s a couple of years after the annual lecture was established, the annual lecture then became the conference theme. It was like, “We&#8217;re going to have a keynote. They’ll speak on this.” Then it seems to be people try and get everyone to speak around that topic. And I suppose the justification is that it’s away for having a relatively coherent conversation – but that never really happens! Conferences might produce a conference volume of key papers. But I think most conferences I go to now would even struggle to find enough coherency for that volume. And it&#8217;s been proposed at the BASR, recently, that perhaps we just abandon the theme and say that it’s a conference for scholars working in, or on, religion in Britain – and just leave it at that. And tell them what the keynotes are. And the keynotes might produce a certain sort of discourse just by their power position as being the keynote speeches. But, yes. It&#8217;s unclear, now, what the utility is. Any thoughts from the others?</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: Well I think it also relates to . . . you know, you can only go to so many conferences each year. I mean, I&#8217;m in New Zealand so, you know, unless the conference is in New Zealand it&#8217;s a very expensive exercise going to conferences. So how do you select which ones to go to?</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: That&#8217;s a good question.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: And maybe that is where the theme comes into play? Because, yes, there&#8217;ll be a core constituency who&#8217;d go to every European Association Conference, right? But for others who don’t have that luxury, then having a theme provides a justification.</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: I don&#8217;t know whether the theme actually helps you with that, to be honest. (Laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: I think if you want to present your research then you&#8217;ll present your research – never mind the theme.</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: I guess, once you go to a conference, you will find scholars sort-of in your field that can give you feed-back, that you can network with. So it&#8217;s not something that a theme will help you with, I feel.</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: I mean, what are the criteria with which you choose a conference? The exotic location? The location of your family on the travel route? Networking opportunities? Who else is going to be there, and what kind of feedback you might get on your paper? You know, and it’s a juggle between all of these different issues, isn&#8217;t it? Some more honourable and some more profane.</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: Not always purely professional.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: And that&#8217;s ok, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s one of the, I&#8217;d say, many perks of an academic life. We can all bitch and moan about all the various stresses and strains. But all the travelling to conferences is one of the perks.</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: Definitely.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Sometimes it&#8217;s funded. Sometimes one decides, “Well, I need a holiday, anyway. And that might be a good environment to go to . . .” Mostly I do it based on the sort-of network of scholars. I go to BASR, now, every single year. And it will continue, because that&#8217;s become my sort of family. It’s a much smaller conference. This is my first European one since 2013 – again because of the financial commitment is quite heavy. But I would have come regardless of what the theme was. But then, there are other conferences. Like, there’s the <a href=\"https://nsrn.net/news/nsrn-conference-2018/\">Non-religion and Secularity Research</a> one in a few weeks, and I&#8217;ll go to that because of the topic. Yes. But that&#8217;s more to do with network. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever actually gone to a conference because of a specific theme. It&#8217;s more I&#8217;ve gone . . . I want to go to that organisation&#8217;s conference, rather than . . .</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: Although even though I&#8217;ve just been saying that themes are pointless: this years&#8217; BASR, I only put in a paper because it did directly relate to my research, and I felt like I probably should!</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: (<strong>15:00</strong>) Well, I think the theme of conferences, although not the only criteria, at least invite people to talk about something different or just look at it from a different angle than they are normally doing. And they&#8217;re normally telling people about their research. And so . . . for applying to get a paper in, you have to, at least . . . I don&#8217;t know . . . tentatively, put in some reference to the conference theme. And I think it&#8217;s a good way. It would be better – or sometimes I think it could be better – if people are directly invited to talk about this: “I know this person, I know him or her. He or she might be an expert on this or that. I would like to hear her talk about this, although it might not be the current research project she&#8217;s working on. But inviting her to say something about that would help to . . . I don&#8217;t know, stimulate another kind of conversation than just repeating myself.”</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Three points: I said I was going to . . . (Laughs). I think we&#8217;re maybe having two conversations. We shouldn&#8217;t allow the behaviour of scholars who tend to just go, “Well, I&#8217;ll fire in whatever paper anyway, and just put a vague allusion to the theme in.” That&#8217;s what we default to doing. But the ideal, where everyone actually engages with the theme, that’s maybe still the ideal to aim for. We shouldn&#8217;t be conflating behaviours with ideals. Another point is that some of us . . . I&#8217;ve certainly had experience of being at very small conferences that you might more describe as workshops. I’ve been at one on atheist identities, one on religious indifference, where there&#8217;s maybe fifteen to twenty-five scholars and it&#8217;s very intense, very focussed discussion. And those conferences have always produced, for me, the best outputs. So maybe there&#8217;s a scale thing? The final point is, I&#8217;ve got a friend who is in Business Studies, in marketing. And she was telling me, she was applying for her first conference. And the selection criteria are very different. You have to write your entire paper ahead, submit it, and then they accept it or reject it. And then you come and present a shortened version of your paper. So we&#8217;re used to presenting a very short vague abstract, and conferences tend to be eager for people to come. Whereas, if the conference was having thousands more people than they could actually take applying then the selection criteria would be quite different, and the coherence of the conference would probably be much higher than it is in our discipline.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: I&#8217;m not sure if you could actually call that kind of workshop experience you had a conference. Because I think that would just mix up terms, and put it in a better light than conferences deserve, I guess!</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: (Laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Because at least in my experience – and I go to different conferences in Religious Studies, but also in Sociology – I never find the discourse there. I just find repetition. Never actually something really new or interesting – or just a few papers presented. And this is in kind of a contradiction to the bare fact that there are more and more conferences that you could go to and you should attend – or you&#8217;re supposed to, if you want to . . . I don’t know, work on your career, or something like that. So I find it really challenging to think about what to do at conferences. What is it we are doing, when we are doing conferencing? And I think, more and more, it turns out to be just some occasion you meet each other and talk to each other, yet the papers and the panels are so full of papers and panels in such a short time, that . . .</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: But is that ok? In the sense that . . . because I&#8217;ve often said that sometimes the papers are the excuse. They&#8217;re the excuse for the funding, they’re the excuse that you give, to justify to yourself for going. And sometimes I&#8217;ve found them . . . . You know, I will use a conference paper as a way to force myself to write something that I&#8217;d been meaning to write for ages. But then, the valuable things are the things like we&#8217;re doing right now, or in the coffee breaks, or at an excellent night out dancing to “The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=kCCiW9LGKoedlwTvrIPoCA&amp;q=YouTube+Thriller&amp;oq=YouTube+Thriller&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.1651.9118.0.9423.17.13.0.3.3.0.106.1054.11j2.13.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.16.1078.0..35i39k1j0i131k1.0.RrXOccNppmI\">Thriller</a>” with <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-steven-sutcliffe\">Steve Sutcliffe</a> and <a href=\"https://docenti.unisa.it/001639/en/teaching?anno=2016&amp;id=505573&amp;cId=9999-2008&amp;pId=N0*N0\">Giovanni Casadio</a> the other night! (<strong>20:00</strong>) (Laughter). Those are the things that stay with you, and sort-of humanise the scholarship. But then, also, all the conversations that happen around a conference . . .</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: In which case, do you think more time should be dedicated to social interactions? Like, you could have . . . take one panel out and just say: “People who want to gather in a room and talk about this topic . . .” – have a round table?</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: But they wouldn&#8217;t . . .</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: If it&#8217;s too much time between the panels they would not – they would just leave. They would split up in very small groups. Friends who haven&#8217;t seen each other for a long time, and then they leave the venue. And then they are all scattered all round the city. And I think some of the conversations that you have between the panellists – this was something I was thinking about the other day: some of the conversations you have between the panellists are actually gaining from the fact that you have to run off just in a few minutes. So you get to your point very quickly – and hope you find some laughs – and then go on your daily routine, at these conferences! So I think if you&#8217;re there too long, with a break between, this might not happen.</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: But if it wasn&#8217;t a break. If it was, like, “This room can be dedicated to this subject,” then have a conversation about it when you got there.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Would you?</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: I think I would like to. (Laughs). Don&#8217;t sound so sceptical!</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: (Laughs). Well, maybe you shouldn&#8217;t call it “a room that you go to to have the conversations”, but maybe you can call it a podcasting studio and also have the ability to record!</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: Yes. If conversation’s valuable thing it would be good to facilitate that, you know?</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: And my facetious thing there is that maybe there are ways that are slightly more innovative than, “Here&#8217;s a room, go and talk.”</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: Well that is a basic presentation of it! (Laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: But the spirit of it, I think, is probably quite good. More . . . like more barbeques, for example! I&#8217;m not saying they all need to be filled with free alcohol and things. But if there was a barbecue every night and all these conversations . . . . Well, then, maybe not as many people would come every night. But those are the places where the exciting things happen.</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: What do we think about the stratification of people at various levels in their academic careers? You know, having a junior scholars&#8217; meeting tends to be something a lot of conferences are doing these days. Workshops for post-graduates. There hasn&#8217;t really been that here. It&#8217;s generally been far less hierarchically organised. But to some degree, what do you miss out from not having those . . . not having kind-of a post-graduate talking shop, or being a bit more aware of facilitating meetings through the hierarchy &#8211; which is still a very kind-of important aspect of university institutions. So should we be doing it by topics? Or should we perhaps be doing it by kind of you know career experience? Any thoughts on that?</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: I think I prefer it by topic. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s because in Edinburgh I feel like I have a good post-graduate community, where we can share post-graduate experiences in that way. And obviously it would be good to come across other post-grads from other places but I feel like I would benefit more from meeting people at all levels, within my subject area. And it would be great if some of them were also post-grads at the same level as me. But also people who have more experience and more range, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: Yes. I usually prefer people with more experience just because they can teach me something about how to improve my research, and how to do stuff, basically. But of course, even a conversation on a topic with a post-grad can be beneficial as well.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Yes, the more democratising things are the better, as far as I&#8217;m concerned. I do like it when you get to rub alongside people right at the top end of the field, and at the bottom end, and where titles don&#8217;t really matter. I mean, like, last night we were just casually sitting with <a href=\"https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veikko_Anttonen\">Veikko Antonnen</a> and just having a beer, talking. There was no pretence of, you know, “He&#8217;s <em>really</em> important. We should be deferring here.”</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: I mean sometimes you don&#8217;t realise who they are until afterwards, anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Which is even better as well. There was one thing I remember: Peggy Morgan organised the BASR&#8217;s 40th Anniversary Conference. She said she insisted on not having name labels, because it means that you go around the conference and you spent the whole time peering at everyone’s chests – maybe somewhat inappropriately – trying to see what their name is (<strong>25:00</strong>). And everyone&#8217;s looking around for a better person to talk to. They&#8217;re waiting to catch that name. And apparently the objection was, “But you could be talking to someone really important, and not realise it!” And her justification was, “Well maybe that&#8217;s the point. If you want to introduce yourself, you introduce yourself. If you want to know someone&#8217;s name, you ask them their name.” A lot of the name badges thing can actually be a way of kind-of spoiling those conversations a little bit, I know.</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: It does save you from the forgetting of names once you&#8217;ve already been introduced.</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: And also, especially when you have so many people from different countries. It&#8217;s really hard to catch the name properly, unless you have a tag.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Yes, and also I think it is also kind of a misconception of how networks and networking works. I mean, in a network your value is defined by being a knot and the ties you have. So the name is some kind of a label of this knot. So talking to someone who has a name, or might have a name, also means you get the connections you might be looking for. So if it is for just coming together and talk about research questions, or something you&#8217;re really interested in topic-wise or something, then this might be a good idea to get rid of badges. But if not, if it is for networking, then it&#8217;s really helpful . . . I mean, like helping to find people.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Yes. I have seen instances where you spot a name badge, and you don&#8217;t know what the person looks like, but you do know their research. And then you spot the name badge and it&#8217;s like: “Yes! Hello! I should speak to you!” Exactly. But that was just feeding into . . . going right back to what Tom was saying: do we want to be coming to this sort of conference and having sitting down just with early career people? Well that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing right now, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Yes it is. And it&#8217;s not surprising, I think. Because all the others are busy doing business as usual. So podcasting is not something that is not quite usual yet, maybe. Maybe we could also talk about this institution of podcasting studio at conferences, as an opportunity to get together and record some conversations . . . to be proving the real thing we are looking for at these kind of events? But coming back to the question, I think it&#8217;s sometimes might be the only way to get the input you need. Because from established professors you normally tend to get just the usual thing you find in their books and papers.</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: I think the point I was driving at – and I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a difference between, say a European conference and an American conference. My suspicion – completely ungrounded – is that an American conference might have more stratified forums where, as early career researchers, you could meet up. But that&#8217;s not for sociability. This is the professionalisation of the trade. And there’s a lot more to this than simply knowing your topic very well. And perhaps doing workshops where you are kind-of professionalised to a degree, would provide that additional aspect to attending a conference – particularly for early career researchers – than just simply attending topic-based panels would provide. So I think that was kind of where I as ruminating around. But of course there&#8217;s drawbacks to that as well. Because you are missing out on the more interesting stuff and just learning the CV-building skills. And so on and so forth.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Just reminding of Paul (<em>audio unclear</em>) analysis of “anything goes”, and the critique of the method, and stuff. He showed that the innovative research is not coming from the old established ones, but from those who haven&#8217;t read the “important books” you should have read at that time, or didn&#8217;t understand it. And then you innovate the hell out this . . . endeavour we call academia. So that might be the place of being here.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Exactly! Well, we&#8217;ve always seen the Religious Studies Project as a way of . . . you know . . . . There are all these existing academic structures there: there&#8217;s hierarchies, there&#8217;s conferences, there&#8217;s journals and everything. (<strong>30:00</strong>) And we never saw the RSP as a way of supplanting that, but as a way of kind-of democratising things a bit; as a way of humanising scholarship and having conversations, alongside what&#8217;s going on, and in an alternative fashion; providing ways of accessing research and ideas that are maybe a little bit more irreverent, a little more accessible. And still acknowledging that the other structures are there. But, you know – do we want to be professionalised? Well, to an extent, yes! We have to be . . .</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: We want to be employed!</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: We want to be employed, but equally there&#8217;s a lot going on in the existing structures that is there just because of habit and tradition and authority. And these little ways, these little things that we&#8217;re doing, will hopefully be ways of challenging that or just forcing it to justify itself. I&#8217;m speaking in huge generalities here, but . . . . Things shouldn&#8217;t be done the way that they are done, just because . . . . And so, having little things that come in and go: “Mmm?”</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Well I don&#8217;t think that this is actually speaking in huge generalities. I think this is the concrete reality you could experience in these kind of conferences: these connections and power struggles within academia. You can really experience it here. And so I would agree that there might be a reason why we&#8217;re not professionalising in a way that, I don’t know, businesses have to . . . . Or get together just for networking purposes only. Because if we are no longer interested in our research topics, then we are no longer researchers!</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Exactly. Tom, you may not want to talk about this, but you&#8217;re just about to go to Honk Kong to a quite different conference. And you were describing, I guess maybe, the perceived differences. And that might be a useful thing to bring in . . . ?</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: Yes. Well I think the first thing to say is that I haven&#8217;t been there yet. So these are all kind-of anticipations which could be completely grounded in my misunderstandings. But it&#8217;s a big public law conference in Hong Kong. And something like 39 concurrent panels, so I&#8217;m not sure how many delegates that adds up to – but pretty huge. But I was at the <a href=\"https://www.otago.ac.nz/lsaanz/index.html\">Law and Society Conference in Otago</a> last year and because you&#8217;ve got a lot of lawyers going to these conferences, it’s not just academics. It&#8217;s a far more kind-of mixing of people who apply the trade, and people who research. And there was a slickness to them: everyone was smartly dressed; and PowerPoints ran to time; and often they would be synchronised with the rehearsed script. And it is impressive when people provide a far more slick presentation. I’m not sure if the ideas rea any better! [Laughter]. But there was a sense that, you know, corporatisation isn&#8217;t all bad. And if it&#8217;s a more efficient and more crisp delivery, and if the PowerPoints aren&#8217;t failing, and people are IT savvy, and they’ve been told to reduce their paper to three or four points – because that&#8217;s what people are able to remember, and you want you papers to be efficacious and to walk away with the key concepts – that aspect of the professionalization, I think, is worthwhile learning from and replicating. Whether the horse will take to water, or whether we&#8217;ll continue to try and preserve some of the more romantic off-the-cuff presentations that do take place in more Humanities-based subjects, is something . . . I don&#8217;t know how things will turn out. It will be very interesting to see how the Hong Kong conference differs from this one.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: I must say that there&#8217;s a spectrum of conference presentation, right? You&#8217;ve got the sort-of very slick end and then you&#8217;ve got this off-the-cuff end. And then, somewhere in the middle, you’ve got the reading of a pre-prepared thing – which I tend to probably do far too often. But the ones that I enjoy are either the ones that are very slick, or the ones that are almost entirely off-the-cuff. You know, they’ve got an idea and they just turn up (<strong>35:00</strong>). And they&#8217;ve got a couple of points and they speak around it. And they don&#8217;t really know where it&#8217;s going to go before it happens. But it can be great.</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: You do need a certain amount of confidence in yourself as an academic to be able to do that, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: Again I think that comes back to the point of professionalisation. Because it gives you those structures with which to be confident through. I don’t think people just emerge confident individuals. They’re given the training. And that kind of aspect, I think, is perhaps undervalued, or not explored enough, or not given enough assistance to people in their early careers.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Well, I would be interested in what you think about the formats that actually prepare one to go to these conferences: what other teaching that may be required, to be prepared presenting in front of an academic professional crowd. Or is there anything you learn during studies and various programmes and universities? Is there something that is reflected in the courses or the structure of the programmes? And is it also reflected in what is worth doing career-wise. Because I have the impression that, at the end, it counts what you have written. And the papers you published in possibly well-known and established peer-reviewed journals. And the books you published. And among us there are only a few people who already published books. But yes, I think this is what counts. And it does not count to be able to get a straight sentence out in front of a crowd listening to you. And in a way I think, this just is reflected . . .</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: Somehow it does, because it allows you to network in an academic sense. And that will lead to publications in some cases.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Ok. But this also, just already prepares you for another written publication.</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: Yes. But I think that with your presentation you will catch the attention on yourself as a researcher and on your research topic. So other people who are interested can contact you even afterwards,</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: And it&#8217;s not necessarily just connected to feeding into publications. I suppose, what are academic outputs? They’re publications, they&#8217;re large research projects and everything. But you&#8217;ve got no idea . . . . And I&#8217;ve seen some presentations here that I&#8217;ve immediately thought, “I need to contact that person for this other project, down the line.” Or sometimes it will be someone else tells you about a paper that they heard, that you weren&#8217;t at, and that personal recommendation can be enough that you will then look at the conference programme, find out who that person was and then seek them out in some sort of other way.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Well my questions were just related to the idea that we might need a professionalisation of conferences. And this sleek point of presenting, 5 points only . . .</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: I&#8217;m saying it through gritted teeth.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: I hope so, yes. Because the reason that we don&#8217;t have that kind of well, established, elaborate presentation style is because we&#8217;re not teaching at universities, and it doesn&#8217;t count that much as writing papers properly. And then to read, to hold a paper, literally, and to read a paper you wrote, that is the thing you do. We have nothing else! I mean, podcast has just started to get a standing in the discipline.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Yes. And the podcasts I recorded yesterday evening, for example, with <a href=\"http://radboud.academia.edu/CarmenBecker\">Carmen Becker</a>, went really well in the sense that she had a narrative worked out for her paper. So she had a twenty-minute narrative, which provided an excellent structure for what ended up being a thirty-five-minute podcast. But we did the same content in a much more – I hope, and Listeners can let me know – conversational and accessible way. We got through it all, but the act of it being a conversation was an alternative presentation format, that will hopefully have complemented the presentation (<strong>40:00</strong>). But maybe, just to put the spotlight on Angela: you&#8217;re relatively new to the conference circuit in a sense, so you might be . . . . What preparation did you get before you stepped up to the podium to deliver your first few papers?</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: Well, actually, I found it quite easy to present in front of people. Because I&#8217;ve been teaching for a few years. And I also do some lecturing. So, yes. And also, well my degrees were in Italy, so at the University of Naples. And there, you have to do a lot of exams – there are presentations but without a PowerPoint. You have to orally answer quite a few questions in a well-structured way. So I think that helped me to organise how I elaborate on my thought and on my research. But yes, maybe the only thing would be to . . . . Yes, I spoke to my supervisor, of course, about what would be the main point that I had to address. So it&#8217;s like a sort of introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: That is what I was thinking. From my outside observation you seem to have a very supportive supervisor in <a href=\"http://research.leedstrinity.ac.uk/en/persons/suzanne-owen(c708dcbb-9f2c-4b28-96e8-88d4c4249a53).html\">Suzanne Owen</a>. I know that I&#8217;ve had very supportive supervisors and now being mentored by <a href=\"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/ppr/about-us/people/kim-knott\">Kim Knott</a> and Steve Sutcliffe, who have sort-of walked me through a lot of these things that might seem quite daunting in an academic career. And I think that, for me, like the first few conferences I went to and everything, having a couple of more established advocates guiding me around, introducing me to people – that really helped.</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: Sometimes it can also help when you have interests beside academia. For example, in my case, I think that since I&#8217;ve been a singer for quite a few years, I think that helped me. Because when I &#8216;m up there it&#8217;s like being on a stage and you have to perform. So I think that doing . . . even other kinds of activities – besides academia – that can help you be more relaxed in front of people, can also help.</p>\n<p><strong>TW</strong>: Yes, by comparison, my hobby is long distance running. (Laughter). I don&#8217;t think that’s comparable to the kind of sociability aspect . . .</p>\n<p><strong>AP</strong>: I guess the other, for example, might be another . . .</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Well the long distance running will help you deal with the long keynote lecture in the warm rooms . . . !</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Both are different ways to deal with stage fright. The one can run off easily, the other can perform!</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Exactly. But you wanted to say something . . . ?</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: Yes. Just a couple of things. Because the first EASR was the one in Helsinki two years ago, I think, and I didn&#8217;t present at that one. And I purposefully went just so I could go to a European conference, suss out the level of things that were happening there. And yes, I had people like Steve Sutcliffe and the whole . . . I think they were referred to as the Edinburgh Mafia at the time, because there was so many of us! And it was really nice just having those people there to introduce me, and not having the pressure to present, but be able to just suss out the situation. And then also, back in Edinburgh, I think in the first year of my PhD, we did a smaller . . . we called it a Post-Grad Colloquium. And that was one where people from all over the Divinity School would present. I can&#8217;t remember whether it was a five or ten-minute paper. But they tried to organise it in a very professional way. And I think the day before there&#8217;d been a different conference at New College, and <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/people/mib46\">Marian Bowman</a> was in Edinburgh and so she came to the Colloquium. So it was quite nice to have a certain level of professionalism there, only have to present for ten minutes. And it was a really good trial run for future presentations.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: But isn&#8217;t it strange that we already fulfil all the requirements of a conference and presenting professionally, even if we&#8217;re just doing post grad or that kind of meeting and workshops just for us, for our sakes, for our research, just to get into conversation and find other people talking about interesting topics. We could do this in many different ways. We could also just meet for podcasting, for example .Just to bring it up once more! (Laughter). Because I think the format is so different. And this kind of professionalisation . . . of the peer pressure you then feel at these big conferences like EASR, or other conferences. (<strong>45:00</strong>) It’s strange, I think, that we already assume all that professionalism is, in that way that we experience it later. And there is no change. There is no real . . . I don&#8217;t know. There is no real development in presentation style.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Yes. We could probably come up with a lot of optimistic things that . . . and think, “Well, surely we could be doing this networking without endless collaboration, without having to have the big carbon footprint and come to this place and sit through lots of papers?” I don&#8217;t know how much we would all . . . actually. The existence of the structure acts as gravitational pull, and people make time for it. But, just another anecdote: I think it&#8217;s maybe over 5 years ago now, that <a href=\"https://religion.ua.edu/profiles/russell-mccutcheon/\">Russell McCutcheon</a> added me as a Friend on Facebook. And I remember it happening and being “Wow! He&#8217;s added me as a Friend on Facebook!” And I&#8217;ve still never met him face to face. And, I don&#8217;t know . . . I think he was aware of the Religious Studies Project and was just purposefully setting out to network and create the network</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Yes. We think of Russell T. McCutcheon as the kind of RSP Twitter-bot. Because he reads everything you guys Tweet!</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Yes. And he engages. But I&#8217;ve now collaborated with him on a number of publications; I&#8217;ve been to conferences that he has helped organise, even though he didn&#8217;t end up going there; we&#8217;ll bounce around Facebook messages and Twitter conversations and I&#8217;m now part of his <a href=\"https://edge.ua.edu/category/russell-mccutcheon/\">Culture On The Edge</a> thing. And all of this has happened without ever needing to go to a conference. And there&#8217;s been a lot of productive collaboration there. And I&#8217;m not saying that we all need to start Facebook stalking and adding people that we&#8217;ve never met before. Because that is just weird, and there are issues with that. (Laughter). But there are other ways perhaps than necessarily coming to a physical space and productive scholarly collaboration can happen. We just maybe need to ignore or think outside the large powerful pull that these things have.</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: And you do need certain ways of making you and your research visible. Because, obviously, you have the platform that Russell was then able to find you on. So it&#8217;s just ways of making that work, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: And the reason I brought this up again is because I think that, with podcasting, we have the kind of medium that gets out conversations in a proper way. And make it possible to quote podcasts, as well. And I think that only a few of those established scholars in the discipline already know how many downloads those podcasts get. If they knew, I think they would realise that their papers in their established and beloved journals never ever will find so many readers than those podcasts find downloads.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: We have already, in this conversation, had more impact than probably every other scholar . . . !</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: And more listeners than any dissertation ever written!</p>\n<p><strong>SB</strong>: Yes. And we briefly touched on it earlier. And you were saying that you go to a conference to present only to then write a paper afterwards. Whereas podcasting occupies that in-between space where you can be quoted on it, you don&#8217;t have to produce this written piece afterwards.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: Exactly. We&#8217;re coming up to 12 O&#8217;clock, which is going to be our time for getting out. I&#8217;m using my “radio host” thing which Moritz has been railing against the whole time. Moritz, I think, would have us talking for another three hours.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: Yes. Definitely. There’s no time limit. There’s always space in the Internet.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: There is always space in the Internet. And this is a point to remember. So hopefully, Listeners, you&#8217;ve enjoyed this conversation. And it&#8217;s, maybe, given you some food for thought about conferencing and maybe alternative ways that you can augment that. And one way would be to participate in the conversation surrounding this podcast. You could record your own podcast and respond in that way; YouTube &#8211; there&#8217;s all the social media options and website options for writing written responses. Don&#8217;t be afraid. Just get out there and say it. A lot of people seem to not really like typing written comments on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: But then you should definitely establish a way to get audio comments as well. So it&#8217;s very easy to record them with WhatsApp or voice memo apps on smart phones (<strong>50:00</strong>). So you could send it easily and in a very nice format. And you could include them in the podcasts.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: That would be a brilliant idea, Moritz! Thank you for that!</p>\n<p><strong>MK</strong>: You&#8217;re welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>CC</strong>: So, Listeners, thanks for listening. We should all say that I suppose. So, from all five of us here in Switzerland:</p>\n<p><strong>All</strong>: Thanks for listening!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Citation Info: </strong>Cotter, Christopher, Sammy Bishop, Moritz Klenk, Angela Puca, Tom White. 2018. “What is the Point of Academic Conferences?”, <em>The Religious Studies Project (Podcast Transcript)</em>. 24 September 2018.

Graber learned that Quakers served as missionaries to Native American reservations in the West. She combined this interest in Quaker missions with her research into Native American captivity, so that the resulting narrative contrasts the motives of U.S. officials with Kiowa captives on an Oklahoma reservation. The main claim of Graber&#8217;s book is that there were two &#8220;gods&#8221; of Indian Country — the religious beliefs of the Kiowas (onto which Western explorers superimposed monotheistic terms like &#8220;Great Spirit&#8221;) versus the Christianity of Protestant and Catholic missionaries. Religion in Graber&#8217;s narrative emerges as a site of contestation in the creation of the American West.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Kiowa material culture and artwork, which Kiowas used to record their history in non-alphabetic ways, Graber shows how the Kiowas adjusted their religious beliefs through contact with the Comanches and other Great Plains Indian nations, as well as the Americans, during the nineteenth century. Kiowas embraced new religious practices, such as the Sun Dance and the two Ghost Dance movements, to gain spiritual power, &#8220;dwdw,&#8221; which could be used to repel American invaders. The Red River War of 1874–75 failed to reclaim Indian Country, but Graber cautions her readers not to read inevitable defeat into this narrative. Letters, drawings, and other objects mailed to the reservation reveal how, after the war, Kiowa men in prison and Kiowa children in boarding schools made sense of their dislocation and retained their culture. Kiowa religion to this day remains an effort to rectify the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Graber shows how colonists cloak violence beneath a veneer of gentility and conquered peoples use religion to preserve their sense of community. This book provides a powerful argument against U.S. &#8220;nation-building&#8221; and the use of state power to break up families — something that the Trump administration is currently doing to Hispanic migrant families along the southern border.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Religious validation of imperialist aggression and Japan’s war efforts in the first half of the 20th century is just one example of this. Japanese religious institutions entered the post-war period with the ethically problematic baggage of war. Promulgation of Japan’s post-war constitution – which introduced a legal separation of religion and the state, demilitarisation of Japan and freedom of religion – opened a new chapter of a supposedly pacifist and secular political system. Religion was relegated to an individual citizen’s private prerogative. However, we are still talking about religion and politics in Japan today.</p>\n<p>Many of the post-war controversies over perceived transgressions between religion, politics and the state have centred on Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which enshrines the souls of Japan’s war dead. Yasukuni Shrine has long been a symbol of Japanese nationalism, with many right-wing factions advocating for nationalising the shrine. A nationalisation movement began in the 1960s and resulted in lawsuits over the involvement of local and national level politicians and governments in rituals held there. Although debates over Yasukuni shrine as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism and fanatic nationalism fuelled by the ideology of state Shinto tend to dominate public and scholarly discourses on conflation of religion and politics, there are many other examples of the ways religion continues to influence Japan’s political life. These include acts of violence and domestic terrorism perpetrated by the new religious movement Aum Shinrikyō in 1995; anti-nuclear activism of religious studies scholars and religious practitioners in the aftermath of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011; and the formation of political representation of religious groups, such as the case of Soka Gakkai and Kōmeitō party in 1964 and their significance in the run-up to the Japanese 2017 general elections.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/soka-gakkai-komeito-and-the-religious-voices-of-japans-political-arena/lotuswhite12/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-12597\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-12597\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lotuswhite12-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"168\"></a>Why should we continue talking about religion and politics in a country that has a constitutional separation of religion and the state? What is the significance of Kōmeitō in Japanese politics today? I asked Levi McLaughlin, who is an Associate Professor at the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at North Carolina State University to talk religion and politics in Japan in the context of his research on Soka Gakkai, one of Japan’s largest lay Buddhist organisations. It is also referred to as one of Japan’s most influential and politically engaged (I dare say) new religions. Levi is a co-author and co-editor of “Kōmeitō: Politics and Religion inJapan” (IEAS Berkeley, 2014), and his new book “Soka Gakkai’s Human Revolution: The Rise of Mimetic Nation” is forthcoming from the University of Hawai’i Press in late 2018.</p>",

We talk about American comics as a product of the immigrant experience, and how comics made by Muslims play with the conventions of the genre.

    "content": "\n<p>Dr. Josephson-Storm&#8217;s first book, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0226412342/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0226412342&amp;linkId=dec65c2ebd736bac8bc490b6bdd4e021\">The Invention of Religion in Japan</a>,&#8221; discussed how, after Commodore Perry forcibly opened Japan to Europeans and Americans in 1853, the Meiji intelligentsia and government remade their country along Western lines. This meant inventing a term, shukyo, that was roughly analogous to the Western word &#8220;religion.&#8221; In other words, an artificial delineation between spiritual practices and other parts of society was introduced to Japan, as part of the quest to be &#8220;modern.&#8221; Another key aspect of religious modernization was the delineation of &#8220;proper&#8221; religions from &#8220;superstition&#8221; and &#8220;magic.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/022640336X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=022640336X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21&amp;linkId=8343f43fb2e2c7a6bdf909520183a510\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ASIN=022640336X&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" alt=\"\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Japanese intellectuals who visited America and Europe realized that the Westerners were not as objective or rational — that is, disenchanted — as they claimed. In fact, many Americans and Europeans believed in Spiritualism, occultism, Theosophy, mesmerism, magnetism, herbal medicine, and other things that didn&#8217;t conform with proper religion (i.e., Christianity). &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/022640336X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=022640336X&amp;linkId=2cabe2556cb0dcfee7c480dc17561733\">The Myth of Disenchantment</a>,&#8221; Josephson-Storm&#8217;s second book, argues that, although Westerners conceived of a philosophical triad — science and Christianity in opposition to magic/Spiritualism/etc. — the triad obscured the ways in which people interacted with each other and blended religion, &#8220;magic,&#8221; and science. There were, and are, many strands of people with varying approaches to religion and modernity. In our interview, Josephson-Storm and I agree that (based on Josephson-Storm&#8217;s research) Western intellectual history is more like a river, with many concepts colliding with each other, than a stable triad or other spatial metaphor. Josephson-Storm argues that it is wrong to assume that the West has progressed beyond myth or magic; it is wrong to assume that religion never influences scientists; and it is wrong to think that major scientific figures avoided occultism, esotericism, Christianity, or other religious traditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss where we go in the study of religion, and in philosophy generally, in the wake of postmodernism. To interrogate categories like &#8220;religion&#8221; and &#8220;magic&#8221; and show their intellectual genealogy, as Josephson-Storm does, is to act in the vein of postmodernism, deconstruction, and other forms of critical theory / Continental Philosophy. But where do we go next? How do we frame our lives, since we cannot deconstruct things forever? Josephson-Storm proposes that we admit the constant reconstruction and manipulation of narratives, so that, instead of getting hung up on flawed categories of modernization or ripping apart arguments infinitely (beware fake news), we admit the world is filled with dynamic tension. If the past way of studying &#8220;civilized&#8221; religion versus &#8220;primitive&#8221; magic is wrong, and if we are honest about our personal biases and the limits of objectivity, then we might achieve a world that is more tolerant of different religions and a world in which scholars produce unconventional, but more accurate, studies of religion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Bulbulia calls ‘religion and spirituality those features of nature [in the biocultural sense of the word] that combine to cultivate a sense of justice in people’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulbulia argues that common across human societies are conceptions of obligation and responsibility: what is owed to others, and what is owed back in return. These sensibilities locate within a complex combination of institutions, traditions, texts, stories, habits, rituals, rules of etiquette, laws and conventions, abstract ideals, and beliefs in God(s) – though this list is not exhaustive! Moreover, beliefs regarding what is owed to the Gods, and what the Gods owe us, is often foundational to these biocultural features of ‘justice’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here ‘justice’ is not synonymous with the ‘good’ or what is ethical. Bulbulia points out societies that have supported slavery or genocide still mapped their behaviour to an understanding of what they ought and ought not do. Situating religion within a concept of justice is not, therefore, a response to a Marxian or Nietzschean suspicion of religion. Instead it explores how or where religious beliefs and practices sit behind the establishment and maintenance of social norms, whatever their moral virtue. Bulbulia argues this framing for the study of religion not only better explains why religious and secular people often make common cause against other religious and secular people, it emphasises the study of religion as integral to a principal aim of the human sciences: working out how and why people behave the way they do.</p>\n",

Humans believe. Meaning, imagination, and hope are as central to the human story as are bones, genes, and ecologies. Neither selfish aggression nor peaceful altruism dominates human behavior as a whole. We are a species distinguished by our extraordinary capacity for creative cooperation, our ability to imagine possibilities and to make them material, and our powerful aptitudes for belief, hope, and cruelty.&#8221; So begins the abstract for Agustín Fuentes&#8217; 2018 Gifford Lecture series at the University of Edinburgh on the topic &#8220;Why We Believe: evolution, making meaning, and the development of human natures.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this wide-ranging interview, Chris and Professor Fuentes discuss the themes of the lecture series, the intersections of research on human evolution, ethnoprimatology, and human nature, with the study of religion more generally, the Planet of the Apes films, and more. Along the way, important distinctions are made between specific &#8220;beliefs&#8221;, &#8220;belief systems&#8221; and the human &#8220;capacity to believe&#8221;, and we ask some important questions about the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All six lectures in the series were filmed, and are available by clicking <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/arts-humanities-soc-sci/news-events/lectures/gifford-lectures/gifford-lectures-2017-2018/professor-dr-agustin-fuentes-why-we-believe\">here</a>.</p>\n",

Here, the notions of &#8216;good&#8217; grief, the use of ritual in creating &#8216;good&#8217; grief, and the very notion of &#8216;religion&#8217; bring to light the active role are able to play in dealing with death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>The twenty-first century has witnessed growing academic and popular interest in a variety of categories which are related to &#8216;religion&#8217; but conceptualized as &#8216;other&#8217;&#8230; atheism, non-religion, secularity, religious indifference, and so on. Each of these categories can be conceptualized as aspects of the general category ‘unbelief’—‘used in a wide sense, implying a generalized lack of belief in a God or gods’ (Lee and Bullivant 2016).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-lois-lee-on-non-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Back in 2012, Chris sat down &#8211; with friend and colleague Ethan Quillen &#8211; to speak to Lois Lee, on the topic of &#8216;non-religion&#8217;</a>. Since then, a lot has changed. Lee has climbed the academic ladder, publishing her first monograph with OUP in 2015 &#8211; Recognizing the Non-Religious: Re-Imagining the Secular &#8211; and currently serving as project leader on the Understanding Unbelief programme. This is a major new research programme aiming to advance scientific understanding of atheism and other forms of ‘unbelief’ around the world through core research and an additional £1.25 million being spent on additional projects and public engagement activities. Chris&#8217;s career has also progressed, with recent work including co-editing New Atheism: Critical Perspectives and Contemporary Debates, and beginning a postdoctoral project engaging in a comparative study of &#8216;unbelief&#8217; in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this podcast, we check in with the state of the field, discuss developments beyond the Anglophone &#8220;West&#8221;, some of the many exciting projects being worked on under the &#8220;Understanding Unbelief&#8221; banner, the utility and pitfalls of the terminology of &#8220;unbelief&#8221;, and some of the critical issues surrounding the reification of survey categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of relevance to the themes discussed, include Marta Trzebiatowska&#8217;s blog post on gender issues in non-religion studies: <a href=\"https://nsrn.net/2016/06/01/not-for-girls-gender-and-researching-nonreligion/\">Not for Girls?

    "content": "\n<p>In this interview Associate Professor Will Sweetman talks to Thomas White about the idea that ‘Hinduism’ and many of the other terms we use to classify religions—including the term religion itself—are modern inventions, emerging out of nineteenth-century inter-cultural contact and European colonialism. Will argues against this critique, and to make his case he draws on historical sources that discuss ‘Hinduism’ both outside of the anglophone experience and long before the nineteenth century. Through identifying alternative, non-anglophone sources of cross-cultural, West-East encounters, where comparative religion is the subject of reflection and description, the concept of ‘Hinduism’ is presented as obtaining a much richer history than the ‘invention thesis’ allows. Such sources include accounts by German Protestant missionaries and those by Jesuits writing in Portuguese, as well as native, expository works by self-reporting Indian religious thinkers. Will argues that ‘Hinduism’ as a concept is older, broader, and indeed more internal to India, than is currently assumed, but this is frequently missed through an overemphasis on relatively late sources almost exclusively in English. The interview goes on to discuss the implications of this research &#8211; and endeavours similar to it &#8211; for the study of religion in general. The interview closes with a brief chat about Otago’s hosting of the IAHR Congress in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*This week’s podcast is sponsored in part by,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://censamm.org/\"><strong>Cen</strong>&nbsp;SAMM.&nbsp;</a>Through their collaboration with INFORM, they’ve created a searchable database of millenarian movements available&nbsp;<a href=\"http://censamm.org/resources/inform-database\">online</a>.*</p>\n",

After receiving a B.A. in Chemistry, she taught high school science for several years. She draws inspiration from the sciences in her current research as a religion scholar. In her investigations of African American Spiritual Churches in New Orleans, Louisiana, Dr. Guillory describes a &#8220;dynamical self,&#8221; a fluid state of identity shifting between the individual and the collective.

Female leadership and business management has been essential in the history of these churches. Dr. Guillory&#8217;s upcoming book draws on years of archival research, ethnographic observation, and oral history interviews to tell the story of these churches from 1920 to the present day. Hurricane Katrina looms large in this story. Most of the physical churches were destroyed in the flooding — or the former inhabitants were not allowed to return as the government began eminent domain proceedings. Yet this religious community endures. Guillory is one of the first scholars to work with the Spiritual Churches, whose affairs remain largely private. Our interview concludes with a discussion of anthropological ethics and practice — how to earn the trust of a community, and how to tell someone else&#8217;s story without &#8220;stealing&#8221; that story.</p>\n",

This has left us with a limited narrative about the man and his work; a particular received or canonical Tylor defined by his introduction of the concept of animism, his intellectualist approach to religion, his armchair research and staunch social evolutionism. The year of his centenary is an opportunity to begin the task of critically examining the legacy left by Tylor’s work on religion and culture, how much the received Tylor matches his body of work, whether other Tylors can be extracted from these texts which undermine such a limited perspective on a long and eventful career and whether contemporary scholars can find anything of ongoing relevance in the work of such a historically distant figure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This roundtable recorded at the annual BASR conference at the University of Chester 2017 brought together a group of scholars interested in different perspectives on the legacy of Tylor. Topics discussed included his impact on indigenous societies, the debates over animism, monotheism and the definition of religion as well as his relevance to the cognitive sciences of religion and the degree to which Tylor can be classed as an ethnographer and more. This roundtable includes contributions from Dr Miguel Astor-Aguilera of Arizona State University, Dr Jonathan Jong of Coventry University&#8217;s Brain, Belief, and Behaviour Lab, James L. Cox Professor Emeritus at the University of Edinburgh, Liam T. Sutherland &#8211; PhD Candidate at the University of Edinburgh, Professor Graham Harvey and Dr Paul Tremlett at the Open University and the much appreciated audience!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The centenary of Tylor&#8217;s death was also the theme for a new volume edited by Tremlett, Sutherland and Harvey &#8216;Edward Tylor, Religion and Culture&#8217; published with Bloomsbury which features contributions from all of the roundtable participants (apart from the audience) and several other scholars, which was launched at the conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*This week’s podcast is sponsored in part by, <a href=\"https://censamm.org/\"><strong>Cen</strong> SAMM.&nbsp;</a>Through their collaboration with INFORM, they’ve created a searchable database of millenarian movements available <a href=\"http://censamm.org/resources/inform-database\">online</a>.*</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>In this interview with Professor Bryan Turner at the Leeds SocRel 2017 conference, we discuss how the sociology of religion can work to stay central to sociology as a broader discipline, by focusing on how religion functions in contemporary political contexts.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/the-political-relevance-of-the-sociology-of-religion/politics/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/POLITICS-300x173.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11766\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/POLITICS-300x173.png 300w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/POLITICS-768x442.png 768w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/POLITICS.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with a consideration of the role religion takes in American political discourse, particularly Trump’s appeals to evangelical communities, Turner discusses how the evangelical ideal of the ‘tender warrior’ can appeal to the blue collar, white, male, working class. This religiously-inflected form of populism is able to bear significant weight on political debates, for example around abortion. This can be compared to the apparent increase of populism in European politics, where the recent success of Emmanuel Macron in France appears to signal that this tide has been halted, for now. Looking even further afield, to Russia and the Philippines, ‘strongman’ politics have become increasingly prominent and relate to religion in different ways: Rodrigo Duterte of the Phillipines has a complicated relationship with the Catholic Church and the Pope, whilst Vladimir Putin allegedly keeps an Eastern Orthodox priest as a counsellor, in an attempt to link Russian identity to Orthodoxy. In many of these cases, religion features heavily in the national insider/outsider debate, further highlighting its salience in contemporary political discourse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the lead of scholars such as Jose Casanova, Professor Turner brings the public and political role of religion into focus. By doing so, he argues, we can push the sociology of religion toward the realms of political theory, international relations, and race relations, thus creating an agenda in which the sociology of religion becomes increasingly mainstream and relevant to the world we live in, rather than fading into a marginal sub-field of sociology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*This week&#8217;s podcast is sponsored in part by, <a href=\"https://censamm.org/\"><strong>Cen</strong> SAMM.&nbsp;</a>Through their collaboration with INFORM, they&#8217;ve created a searchable database of millenarian movements available <a href=\"http://censamm.org/resources/inform-database\">online</a>.*</p>\n",

And does this make it ‘religious’?), we are delighted to end 2017 on a more light-hearted note and present our mid-year special gameshow, with added video nonsense. This year, the game was “Scrape My Barrel” — which has absolutely no connection to the popular BBC gameshow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_My_Bluff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Call My Bluff”</a> — and sees two teams of Religious Studies academics pitted against each other in a battle of definitions, pedantry, creativity, deception, performance and ‘wit’. Quite like any typical RS seminar room, then?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, we recorded at the BASR Annual Conference at the University of Chester back in September 2017, and we were delighted to welcome back Jonathan Tuckett to the role of host after permitting him an ill-advised sojourn to the ‘other’ side of the podium in 2016. &nbsp;The teams were made up of ‘established’ RS scholars – George Chryssides, Dawn Llewellyn and Paul-François Tremlett – and ‘up-and-coming’ <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">baristas</span> RS scholars – Vivian Asimos, Liam Sutherland and Amy Whitehead. Each brings their own inimitable style to the table, and certainly provided an entertaining evening for conference attendees (who also double as our fabulous studio audience).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Scrape My Barrel! | Mid-Year Special 2017\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w8T2KBt8Uf4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If this gets you in the festive mood, you might want to check out our back catalogue of festive specials:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2012 &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/christmas-special-only-60-seconds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Only Sixty Seconds!</a></li><li>2013 &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/christmas-special-2013-nul-point/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nul Point!</a></li><li>2014 &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/christmas-special-2014-masterbrain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Masterbrain!</a></li><li>2015 &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/christmas-special-2015-fourteen-to-one/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">14-to-1!</a></li><li>2016 &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/xmas-special-2016/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Unverifiable Truth-Claim!</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download this podcast, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/donations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">donations</a> page?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone at the University of Chester who facilitated the recording of this episode, to David Robertson for some excellent editing work, to our camera people, to the contestants, the studio audience, and everyone who has contributed to the RSP over the past year.

    "content": "\n<p>If you were asked to name the TV programs with the most religious content and references what would you name? 7th Heaven, Supernatural or perhaps Games of Thrones? How many of us would name animated television series such as The Simpsons, Family Guy or South Park? These television series are amongst the most religions on our screens. Indeed, 95% of The Simpsons episodes, 84% of Family Guy episodes, and 78% of South Park episodes contain explicit religious references. These animated comedy shows are critically influential in teaching viewers about religious people and religious institutions. The commentary created via the intersection between humour, satire, and religion in these TV shows, particularly in their own context of America, creates an interesting image of what it supposedly means to be a “good religious American”. In this podcast Associate Professor David Feltmate, author of Drawn to the Gods: Religion and Humor in The Simpsons, South Park, and Family Guy, chats to Breann Fallon about the manner in which these three television shows create a broad commentary on religion for the general public. Feltmate highlights the central place these animate programs have in the proliferation of ideas about the spiritual and the religious, as heavily consumed mediums of popular culture.</p>\n",

To discuss this, we are once again joined by Susan Palmer, who draws on her vast ethnographic work with such groups to give real-world examples, showing the complexity of the issue. children, it seems, become the central focus of the ideological struggle between the state and the alternative offered by these groups.

In this interview, we talk with Elena Shih about her ethnography of missionary vocational training rehabilitation projects that train sex workers in Beijing and Bangkok to make jewelry that is sold in the United States, and what this can show us about transnational dynamics of religious activism and non-governmental organizations enacted through the corollary motives of salvific evangelism and social entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the turn of the twenty-first century, there has been a remarkable surge of interest among both academics and policy makers in the effects that religion has on international aid and development. Within this broad field, the work of ‘religious NGOs’ or ‘Faith-Based Organisations’ (FBOs) has garnered considerable attention. This series of podcasts for The Religious Studies Project seeks to explore how the discourses, practices, and institutional forms of both religious actors and purportedly secular NGOs intersect, and how these engagements result in changes in our understanding of both ‘religion&#8217; and ‘development’. These interviews with leading scholars working on the topic across diverse contexts in Asia (and beyond) have been conducted by Dr. Catherine Scheer &amp; Dr. Giuseppe Bolotta of the National University of Singapore’s Asia Research Institute. Our work on this has been generously supported by a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation.</p>\n",

Such testimony tends to receive privileged treatment in anti-cult literature, while some academics are prone to be sceptical, even suggesting ex-member testimony is worthless due to the danger of adaption and fiction. So a question remains, how should religious studies scholars deal with such testimony. Do we treat it as fact, fiction, faction, or something else altogether? In this interview at the 2017 British Association for the Study of Religion (BASR) Conference, Breann Fallon chats to Dr George Chryssides about ex-member narratives and the use of such primary sources in the work of religious studies scholars. Issues of identity creation, the alteration of narratives, the use of &#8220;faction&#8221; as evidence, and case studies from ex-member Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses come together in this interview to create a compelling case for a renewed focus on ex-member testimony.</p>\n",

Starting with a critique of North American sociology’s approach to religion, Spickard emphasises how our concepts of religion are historically grounded, arising from a particular time and place. How can we remedy this, and how can we look at our own concepts more critically and reflexively? Spickard presents three examples of how religion might be understood differently – from the point of view of Confucianism, Navajo religion, and the work of Arab scholar Ibn Khaldoun – and shows how these different approaches can alter our perspectives. What can Confucianism show us about North American church congregations? How can the work of Ibn Khaldoun affect our understandings of race and ethnicity? Building on ideas such as Raewyn Connell’s Southern Theory, Spickard explores how researchers could begin to move toward a ‘world-conscious sociology of religion’.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Following his Albert Moore Memorial Lecture at Otago University, celebrating 50 years of Religious Studies at Otago, Professor Wesley Wildman talks to Thomas White regarding the integration of the sciences and the humanities in his bio-cultural approach to the study of religion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wildman argues that the methods and knowledge of the empirical sciences, from evolutionary biology to neuroscience, are increasingly gaining authority in the study of religion. This is to be welcomed. Yet when scientists pursue the study of religion unassisted, they can often slip into simple category errors, or fail to recognise important contextual nuance. The expert collaboration of humanities scholars is essential for ensuring this new and growing area of scholarship remains conceptually rigorous and culturally informed. The two fields of academia must work together, but sometimes, institutional and ideological barriers can prevent such cooperation, not least regarding the use of ‘religion’ as a general category.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/modelling-religion-and-the-integration-of-the-sciences-and-the-humanities-in-the-bio-cultural-study-of-religion/tom_white_wesley_wilding_27-jul-2017-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-11366\"><img src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tom_White_Wesley_Wilding_27-Jul-2017-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Tom_White,_Wesley_Wilding_27-Jul-2017\" class=\"wp-image-11366\"/></a><figcaption>Tom White (left) and Wesley Wildman (right)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Wildman’s current project ‘Modelling Religion’ (which uses computer simulations to explore religious behaviour), offers a compelling case for Wildman’s mixed methods approach. Whilst also admitting the project’s limitations, Wildman explains how computer simulations of social and psychological processes can provide fresh input on long-standing, previously irresolvable theoretical debates in the study of religion. The interview finishes with Wildman speaking on the practical aspects of working on such mixed-method projects, including how younger scholars should prepare themselves should they wish to participate in similar research endeavours in future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This podcast is sponsored by the postgraduate taught programmes (<a href=\"http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site%2Fview&amp;id=611\">Masters</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site%2Fview&amp;id=66\">PhD</a>) in Religious Studies at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

Stephen Jacobs, a senior lecturer at Wolverhampton University, and Theodora Wildcroft, a PhD researcher at Open University UK, are both interested in the common presence of yoga and bhakti tradition in the contemporary British rave and festival communities. This podcast explores how Hindu belief and traditions have been incorporated into modern western practices. An overview of the British kirtan community and the Art of Living movement is followed by a discussion of authenticity, reconciliation of tradition and modernity, and the influence of popular culture. As appropriation of culture and questions of authenticity pervade conversations across fields, the study of contemporary British Hindu movements is important in understanding how millennia old religious traditions are being used in new, modern contexts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This podcast is sponsored by the postgraduate taught programmes (<a href=\"http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site%2Fview&amp;id=611\">Masters</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site%2Fview&amp;id=66\">PhD</a>) in Religious Studies at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

Brown provides a historic overview of bodily–religious practices in America, starting with mesmerism, occultism, osteopathy, and chiropractic in the nineteenth century. These practices challenged the standard &#8220;heroic&#8221; model of medicine: Instead of the patient experiencing torturous medical treatments, a practitioner simply realigns the patient&#8217;s body or does a quick procedure. Such bodily practices blurred, in some cases, with Pentecostal and Holiness Christians&#8217; use of prayer as a medical treatment. (Today, many chiropractors retain an interest in bodily energy and proper alignment, though they may not articulate this view to their patients.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the nineteenth century progressed, many Americans consumed translations of Hindu and Buddhist literature. Asian concepts of bodily practice and energy fields (qi, meridians, chakras) entered the lexicon of new American religions. Theosophy, in particular, borrowed from Hindu and Buddhist concepts. The introduction of Eastern metaphysics to America created a small market for the introduction of yoga. This market grew in the 20th century as Vivekananda and Yogananda brought forms of yoga (and, in Yogananda&#8217;s case, a hybrid of Hinduism &amp; Christianity) to the U.S. Today, evangelical Christians are adopting yoga, finding parallels between chakras and the Holy Spirit, or — in an act of cultural appropriation — creating a new kind of yoga shorn of Hindu references. The American Hindu community has criticized such cultural appropriation. Some Hindus have also suggested that a Christian doing yoga poses, or asana, may slowly convert to Hinduism, making evangelical yoga a stealth victory for Vedic culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interview concludes with a discussion of Dr. Brown&#8217;s field research methods, along with her and Mr. Gorman&#8217;s thoughts about secularization in America and the inadequacies of secularism as a research concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:&nbsp;</strong><em>On 29 June 2017 we published <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2017/06/29/stretching-good-faith-a-response-to-candy-gunther-brown-philip-deslippe/\">a response to this interview, written by Philip Deslippe</a>, which provides an important and well-argued counter-narrative to this interview.

Cooper Harriss, author the book Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Theology, discusses his thoughts on the unseen theological dimensions of Ralph Ellison’s writings. Harriss begins with the figure of Ellison, whose novel, Invisible Man, offers a now-classic metaphor (“invisibility”) depicting the socio-cultural and political issues and obstacles that African Americans experienced in the mid-twentieth century. By claiming the invisible not simply as a materialist term but a metaphysical one as well, Harriss contends that despite—or even because of—his status as a thoroughly “ secular” novelist and critic, Ellison’s writing reflects important theological trends and issues that mark his age and the cultural inheritances of his literary production. Harriss also identifies the scholars and thinkers who inform the methodological moves that he makes in the book, and he reflects on the abiding relevance of Ellison’s life and insights. Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Theology troubles regnant assumptions surrounding the religious and theological dimensions of racial identity and, indeed, the very fraught relationships between the terms “religion” and “theology” in contemporary academic discourse.</p>\n",

This session dealt with Dr. John McGreevy (History, Notre Dame)&#8217;s new book, &#8220;American Jesuits and the World.&#8221; Maffly-Kipp and Thomas Bender (History, NYU) gave remarks about the book; McGreevy responded; and two hours of Q&amp;A with scholars and graduate students followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My conversation with Maffly-Kipp begins with McGreevy&#8217;s book, expands to include her work on Mormonism in contrast to Catholicism, and ends with a discussion of evangelical historian Mark Noll, in whose honor Notre Dame was originally going to host a conference, but was cancelled at the last minute. This free-ranging conversation nonetheless centers on Jesuits, Mormons, and transnational religious history.</p>\n",

Brooks, Professor of Religion at the University of Rochester, discusses how he became involved in the academic study of Hinduism, specifically Tantra and goddess-centered traditions. He begins with his training in Sanskrit and Tamil at Middlebury College, where he found that little English work had been done on Hindu traditions for some years. Living intermittently in India during the 1970s–80s, Brooks found a lack of secular studies of Hinduism, as opposed to religious devotional studies. Given these challenges, Brooks has had to study Tantric Hinduism from within and without the traditions. On the one hand, his friendship with Dr. Gopala Aiyar Sundaramoorthy introduced him to the lived practice as well as venerable philosophical traditions of Tantra and tantric yoga. Working with Sundaramoorthy, Brooks was &#8220;within&#8221; a vibrant Hindu tradition. As he refined his work at Harvard Divinity School, however, Brooks articulated a critical, non-religiously invested perspective on Hinduism — in short, observing Tantra from &#8220;without,&#8221; treating the religion like any other secular subject worthy of study. This approach caused Brooks to clash with older scholars at HDS, who assumed that Judeo-Christian terms and concepts were universally applicable to all religions. Later in the interview, Brooks discusses his interpretation of Tantric yoga, giving particular attention to the philosophy&#8217;s doctrine of application to daily problems. This kind of yoga is distinct from the New Age, exercise-based style of yoga that B.K.S. Iyengar and others popularized in the West. In recent years, Brooks has attended many popular yoga workshops with the goal of educating the general public about genuine Tantric philosophy from India. He concludes with some reflections on public service as an academic and his plans for a new book on Tamil pilgrimages.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Alongside the problematic dominant caricature of Islam as a violent religion, there is perhaps no other issue so problematic in contemporary Western discourse on Islam than discussions sexuality and gender. Western stereotypes of the downtrodden Muslim woman are often countered by the claims of Islamic scholars that women are more liberated, respected and secure within Islam than in other religions or in the &#8220;secular&#8221; West. Regular listeners to <em>The Religious Studies Project</em> will be unsurprised to learn that there is a lot more going on below the surface of these dominant discourses. Why are &#8220;we&#8221; even having this discussion about sexual ethics and Islam? How might one begin to study such a vast and &#8220;problematic&#8221; topic? What are some of the most prescient issues that recur in this contested field? And what is the broader significance of this discussion for Religious Studies in general? To discuss these issues and more, Chris is joined this week by Professor Kecia Ali, of Boston University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out a recent lecture by Kecia on sexual ethics and Islam <a href=\"https://media.ed.ac.uk/media/Professor+Kecia+AliA+Sexual+Ethics+and+Islam/1_nfdso7ax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n",

Is this a fortuitous event or the product of a higher purpose? It is quite common in certain communities to report the experience of God working in an individuals life, and personal experience is often used as testimony in establishing the reality of a particular supernatural agent. The inquisitive mind will ask: What can science say about supernatural attributions? Does scientific evidence have any bearing at all on the existence of a God or gods? In this podcast, Thomas J. Coleman III interviews Dr. Luke Galen on his latest theoretical work (preprint available here: <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ech9x/\">https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ech9x/</a>), which combines evidence from across the psychological sciences to address how natural processes influence attributions of supernatural agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jesus, did you see what GOD just did to us man??\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eujCeBC4Lh0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n",

However, up until today we have never tackled head-on the institutional location of Religious Studies within a higher education environment that is becoming increasingly stretched, and dominated by market forces and political whims. In particular, how might this situation affect graduate education it the study of &#8216;religion&#8217;? What can scholars of &#8216;religion&#8217; do about this situation? Are we powerless?

Whether we take a look at small-scale or complex societies, we can find that politics is involved with economics, kinship with hierarchy, and of course, religion with the state. The relationship between the last two has been shaped by numerous processes throughout human history; but, if we place our attention in the history of the western world, we can identify a turning point, one that started with the first waves of enlightened thought (eighteenth century), continuing with the posterior massive drop-out of catholic religiosity, and culminating with the total separation of religion and the state. In this podcast, Sidney Castillo interviews professor Marco Huaco Palomino as he addresses the nuances of secularity in several Latin American countries.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5633\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-10414-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-212-Huaco.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-212-Huaco.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-212-Huaco.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-212-Huaco.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=10414-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-212-Huaco.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP-212-Huaco.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('10414-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_10414-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_10414-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5634&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-10414-2&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-212-Huaco.mp3?_=2&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-212-Huaco.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-212-Huaco.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

Violence inflicted against people of all gender and sexual orientations comes in numerous forms, and is something to which many faiths are connected in some way. In this podcast Dr Caroline Blyth discusses her research on &#8216;theologies of rape&#8217; and gender violence as enacted against males and masculinity, particularly within the Christian Church. Blyth also discusses her upcoming edited series Rape Culture, Gender Violence and Religion (edited with Dr Emily Colgan and Dr Katie Edwards). In latter part of the interview, Blythe is joined by a contributor to the series who discusses his experience in the LGBTI community and how that has impacted his academic work in the volume. The two also discuss their involvement with Hidden Perspectives at the University of Auckland, a project that provides a platform for LGBTI student voices within the Faculty of Arts teaching and research community.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5635\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-10380-3\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-211-Blythe.mp3?_=3\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-211-Blythe.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-211-Blythe.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-211-Blythe.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=10380-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-211-Blythe.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP-211-Blythe.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('10380-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_10380-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_10380-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5636&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-10380-4&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-211-Blythe.mp3?_=4&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-211-Blythe.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RSP-211-Blythe.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

It’s a cherished idea that is easy for state governments to enact, no? In this interview, Finbarr Curtis questions both of these assertions. In The Production of American Religious Freedom, Curtis argues that religious freedom is a fluent and malleable concept that people deploy for various and competing reasons. Curtis uses several case studies to illustrate how the rhetoric of religious freedom has no coherent logic. This discussion has both legal and political implications, as it concludes that one of modernity’s most important concepts—religious freedom—is both unobtainable and undesirable.</p>\n",

This victory was, by current understandings of AI, a vast leap forward towards a future that could contain human-like technological entities, technology-like humans, and embodied machines. As corporations like Google invest heavily in technological and theoretical developments leading towards further, effective advances – a new ‘AI Summer’ &#8211; we can also see that hopes, and fears, about what AI and robotics will bring humanity are gaining pace, leading to new speculations and expectations, even amidst those who would position themselves as non-religious.</p>\n<p>Speculations include Transhumanist and Singularitarian teleological and eschatological schemes, assumptions about the theistic inclinations of thinking machines, the impact of the non-human on our conception of the uniqueness of human life and consciousness, and the moral boundary work of secular technologists in relation to their construct, ‘religion’. New religious impulses in the face of advancing technology have been largely ignored by the institutions founded to consider the philosophical, ethical and societal meanings of AI and robotics. This roundtable is an initial conversation on this topic, with the intention for further discussion and publications.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5639\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-10239-7\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/RSP-208-AI-Roundtable.mp3?_=7\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/RSP-208-AI-Roundtable.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/RSP-208-AI-Roundtable.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/RSP-208-AI-Roundtable.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=10239-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/RSP-208-AI-Roundtable.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP-208-AI-Roundtable.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('10239-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_10239-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_10239-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5640&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-10239-8&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/RSP-208-AI-Roundtable.mp3?_=8&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/RSP-208-AI-Roundtable.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/RSP-208-AI-Roundtable.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

In this RSP interview, we are joined by professor Dorothea Ortmann from the University of Rostock, to discuss the foundations of the study of religion in this country. She first states the major differences between the confessional studies or studies oriented to theological or pastoral matters, and the social scientific study of religious phenomena (Ortmann, 2004). She then follows the conversation by giving some background history of the most notable works from the first attempts at doing research on the sciences of religion. Particularly important are the works of Tello (1943), Larco Hoyle (1946), Valcárcel (2009), and Carrión (2005).</p>\n<p>In what remains of the interview, professor Ortmann discusses the public benefits of studying religion. It ends with an interesting discussion about the current institutional and theoretical situations of the field in Peru, taking into account new tendencies coming from Europe and North America (Xygalatas, 2015).</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5641\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-10212-9\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ortmann.mp3?_=9\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ortmann.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ortmann.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ortmann.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=10212-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ortmann.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"Ortmann.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('10212-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_10212-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_10212-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5642&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-10212-10&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ortmann.mp3?_=10&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ortmann.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ortmann.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

However, the interplay between religion and humour comes in many forms; comedy films, stand-up comedy, musicals, satire, and kitsch products are just a few platforms in which religion and humor come together. In this RSP interview from our friends in Australia, Dr Elisha McIntyre discusses her research into religion and humour, particularly looking at comedic work The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as well as a broad range of evangelical comedians. McIntyre discusses the use of religious comedy as a point of entertainment as well as an identity solidifier, evangelical tool, and preaching format within Christianity.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5645\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-10067-13\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/McIntyre-2.mp3?_=13\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/McIntyre-2.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/McIntyre-2.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/McIntyre-2.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=10067-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/McIntyre-2.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"McIntyre-2.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('10067-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_10067-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_10067-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5646&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-10067-14&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/McIntyre-2.mp3?_=14&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/McIntyre-2.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/McIntyre-2.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

Indeed, it was James Cox&#8217;s excellent introduction to the topic back in February 2013, and the accompanying response that asked what Religious Studies should do &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-after-the-world-religion-paradigm/\">After the World Religions Paradigm&#8230;?</a>&#8221; that prompted David and Chris, with some encouragement from Steve Sutcliffe, Russell McCutcheon and Craig Martin, to co-edit the volume &#8220;published in February 2016 with Routledge.

    "title": "Researching Radicalisation",
    "content": "\n<p>Radicalisation, fundamentalism or extremism, are terms which are highly prevalent in media, public, political, and legal discourse these days, and are surrounded by mystification, rhetoric and ideological assumptions that work against clear, objective, non-partisan understandings of the phenomena they denote. Regular listeners to the RSP will be unsurprised that we look askance at such discourses and aim to take a critical approach to this controversial topic. What might the academy mean by the term &#8216;radicalisation&#8217;? How might we study it? What makes it different from &#8216;socialisation&#8217;? Is there a necessary connection between &#8216;religion&#8217; &#8211; or particular forms of &#8216;religion&#8217; &#8211; and radicalisation? And how might we position ourselves in relation to other actors &#8211; in politics, the military, or the media &#8211; who have a vested interest in our research?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To discuss these and other issues, we are joined this week by Dr Matthew Francis, Senior Research Associate at Lancaster University and Communications Director for the Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats (CREST). In this interview we discuss what we mean by &#8216;radicalisation&#8217;, and what its connections to socialisation, terrorism, and &#8216;religion&#8217; might be. We take on the methodological question of how one might go about researching such a contested topic, and look specifically at some of Matthew&#8217;s findings relating to the causes of radicalisation, and the neo-Durkheimian &#8216;sacred&#8217;. We also reflect on the position of the researcher when approaching topics entangled such vested political interests, negotiating the media, and future research directions.</p>\n\n\n<p>Be sure to check out other great podcasts on: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-brian-victoria-on-zen-buddhist-terrorism-and-holy-war/\">Zen Buddhism Terrorism and Holy War</a> with Brian Victoria; <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-mark-juergensmeyer-on-sociotheology-and-cosmic-war/\">Sociotheology and the Cosmic War</a> with Mark Juergensmeyer; <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-jolyon-mitchell-on-religion-violence-and-the-media/\">Religion, violence and the Media</a> with Jolyon Mitchell; <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-eileen-barker-on-studying-cults/\">Studying &#8220;Cults&#8221;</a> with Eileen Barker; <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-gordon-lynch-on-the-sacred/\">The Sacred</a> with Gordon Lynch; and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/pilgrimage-in-japan-and-beyond-an-interview-with-ian-reader-part-1/\">Pilgrimage in Japan and Beyond</a> with Ian Reader and Paulina Kolata.

    "content": "\n<p>Apparently, the only two certain things in life are death and taxes. In terms of the former, the requiem has held its grip up until contemporary times. While popular requiems, such as those composed by Mozart and Rutter are still performed, newly composed requiems, or requiem-like pieces are growing in popularity in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe. These requiems make use of previously employed lyrics and composition techniques, but some also rework these elements or leaving them behind entirely. From Mozart, to hip-hop, to haiku, contemporary music for the commemoration of death is variegated in its composition. In this interview, Breann Fallon discusses contemporary requiems with Associate Professor M.J.M. Hoondert of Tilburg University while at the 2016 European Association for the Study of Religions conference in Helsinki. Hoondert highlights the variety of contemporary requiems, noting their different styles, imagery, and convergences, but also the intended affect of the works. In particular, Hoondert discusses the step away from the liturgy associated with requiems as way for today&#8217;s individual to deal with death or violence in their own way. Still, it is clear that the ritual elements of the requiem remains, hence where this contemporary music fits into the sacral landscape is up for debate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, be sure to check out <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/death-religion-and-terror-management-theory/\">DEATH, Religion, and Terror Management Theory</a> with Jonathan Jong</p>\n",

Young people as mere containers for the religiosity of their parents. Creative reinterpretation of stagnant traditions. Systemic abuse and lack of agency. And so on. In the context of the United Kingdom, where we are recording today, with its historically hegemonic Christianity, one scholar has written that</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-9726\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funny_old_people_15-300x230.jpg\" alt=\"young_old\" width=\"241\" height=\"185\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funny_old_people_15-300x230.jpg 300w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/funny_old_people_15.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#8220;It is no secret that Christian churches are struggling to attract and retain young people. The current generation of young people has largely abandoned the church or never known it as a significant part of their lives. The 2005 church census revealed that many churches have no young people at all in their congregations: around half have no 11- to 14-year-olds attending and well over half have no 15- to 19-year-olds (Brierley 2006).&#8221; (Stanton 2012, 385)</p>\n<p>But of course, this misses much of what is going on. That scholar is Naomi Thompson (formerly Stanton) who joins us today on the Religious Studies Project to give us a more nuanced overview of the broad topic &#8220;Religion, Youth, and Intergenerationality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We begin this interview by asking what is &#8216;youth&#8217;? How do sociologists define it? What are some of the current trends in sociological research on youth? What, if anything, is distinctive about youth experience? Discussion then turns to &#8216;religion and youth&#8217;, focusing on why scholars might be interested in it, the current state of play, common assumptions, how we might go about researching it, before focusing on some of Dr Thompson&#8217;s own research. Towards the end of the interview, we focus on the &#8216;transmission model&#8217; and the relationship between generations, before thinking to the future of this growing area of research.</p>\n<p>This episode is the fourth in a series co-produced with <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/religion-and-feminism/\">Religion and Feminism</a>&#8216; with Dawn Llewellyn, &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/evangelicalism-and-civic-space/\">Evangelicalism and Civic Space</a>&#8216; with Anna Strhan, and &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/an-introduction-to-the-sociology-of-religion/\">An Introduction to the Sociology of Religion</a>&#8216; with Grace Davie.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>Stanton, Naomi. 2012.

    "content": "<p>In Martin Stringer’s Discourses on Religious Diversity (2013a), and in further elaborations (2013b; 2014), he paints a picture of some of the prevalent everyday discourses on ‘religious diversity’ which he and his doctoral students have encountered over several years working in Birmingham, Manchester, London and other cities, bringing a large body of variously ‘circumstantial data’ (Stringer 2013a, 2) into conversation with new and innovatively gathered material (Stringer 2013b) and broader academic literature from anthropology and urban studies.</p>\n<p>In this interview, we discuss the broad topic of diversity, contrast this with concepts of &#8216;difference&#8217;, and ask what on Steven Vertovec might mean by the concept of &#8216;super-diversity&#8217; (2007). We then ask why scholars might be interested in situations of &#8216;religious diversity&#8217;, how they might avoid becoming mere puppets of the state, how this differs from &#8216;multiculuralism&#8217;, and how we might go about doing such research. Using examples from case studies in the Birmingham districts of Highgate and Handsworth, Stringer argues that scholars need to pay attention to the particularities of the localities in question, and that we need to rehink just how we disseminate the results of our research for public usage.</p>\n<p>This interview was recorded at the BASR Annual Conference at the University of Wolverhampton, and draws on Professor Stringer&#8217;s keynote lecture &#8220;Beyond Difference: Challenging the Future for Religious Studies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out Martin&#8217;s previous podcast on &#8216;Situational Belief&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-martin-stringer-on-situational-belief/\">here</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Stringer, Martin D. 2013a.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://Discourses of Religious Diversity: Explorations in an Urban Ecology\">Discourses of Religious Diversity: Explorations in an Urban Ecology</a>.

White presents his own methodological approaches and theoretical data utilising both emic and etic sources in a thematic framework. Based on the sheer number of people identifying as Wiccans, book sales, the media, and the popularity of the term, White argues that Wicca is truly the most popular and widespread expression of modern Paganism. He then discusses the ‘invented’ claims of Wicca being a continuity of European pre-Christian religious beliefs and practices, the relationship between religion and magic in Wiccan discourse in reference to theological elements and ritual practices that define Wicca, and then a cross-comparison of Wiccans and self-proclaimed practitioners of ‘Traditional Witchcraft’. White also discusses the divide in Wicca over more traditionally inclined practitioners and more modern eclectic practitioners. Regarding the socio-political dimensions of Wicca, White examines ways in which Wiccan discourse can be conceived as a political activist movement regarding gender rights, environmental issues, and socio-economic policies. On a final note, White dissects the current academic debate on the ‘rights’ and ‘wrongs’ of scholars who are Wiccans studying other practitioners of Wicca, and concludes by presenting his own view on what the future holds for Wicca.</p>\n<p>Listeners might also be interested in our podcasts on <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/21st-century-irish-paganism/\">21st Century Irish Paganism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-suzanne-owen-on-druidry-and-defining-religion-in-the-uk/\">Druidry and the Definition of Religion</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-graham-harvey-on-animism/\">Animism</a>, amongst others.</p>\n",

What roles to scholars play in the application of the term to new groups?

Starting from a historical and comparative study of religion, Juergensmeyer advocates for a new approach to religion, as it exists today in a globalized framework. As such, in his most recent book, God in the Tumult of the Global Square (2015), he examines the ethical and moral dimensions brought on by environmental changes concerning religious people, spiritual, but not religious people, and the people who identify with none of those categories alike. He interrogates the intersections of different religions traditions, questions the world religion paradigm as taught in universities today, and examines new phenomena caused by decentralized localized antiauthoritarian characteristics of globalization.</p>\n",

In the classical period, yoga took on a variety of other meanings, including yoking the mind-body complex through meditative practices, such as breath control and mantras, to achieve liberation. Yoga was an analysis of perception and cognition, whereby to know something is to be it; higher states of consciousness could expand individuals into the universe and even to omniscience. Yoga also included achieving superpowers through sexual and other bodily alchemical practices, allowing practitioners to see through things and to take over other human bodies. In tantric yoga, which developed during the medieval period, the goal became not union with the absolute but rather to become a living god, a yogi, through occult practices. In hatha yoga, practitioners regulated their breath and channeled vital fluids within the body, via chakras, in order to achieve awakening and supernatural powers. Contemporary forms of yoga as postural practice developed from Hindu Vedanta, Indian nationalism, the Orientalist resurrection of the Yoga Sutras, Theosophy, Swedish gymnastics, and other sources, and constitute a relatively recent phenomenon in the history of yoga. Even more recently, the study of yoga in North America has been riven by debates about what counts as “authentic” yoga and who gets to make such claims authoritatively, as the Hindu America Foundation’s Take Back Yoga campaign can attest.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"></div>\n",

For Jaspers, this collection of philosophical and theological works was a sign of an era of social and intellectual maturity, a maturation that Jasper felt left simpler formulations of such thinking in its wake. The notion of the “Axial Age” has held through to the 21st century, the most recent manifestation of the theory being seen in Robert N.

Dr Jack Tsonis has recently taken up a position at Western Sydney University, teaching the Masters of Research Program. They discuss the origin and historiography of the term “Axial Age” before diving into an analysis of the term as used in Religious Studies. Tsonis gives a fiery critique of the racial, ethnic, and religious stereotypes upon which the term is founded, and the subsequent need for avoidance of the term “Axial Age” and all that it embodies. Later, they discuss the difficulties of the immediate post-PhD years, particularly the delicate research-teaching balance, resulting in some useful advice for anyone in their final PhD months or for those who have recently submitted.</p>\n",

Sometimes, stories which at one time seemed far-fetched receive widespread acceptance and become the hegemonically accepted norm. At others, they remain the preserve of relatively small groups of &#8220;nutters&#8221;, and become designated as &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221; by those who have the power to do so. What might this popular discursive trope be able to tell us about contemporary Western society?

The interview begins with David&#8217;s own journey to this research field, before considering some basic questions such as &#8220;what is a conspiracy theory?&#8221; David then lays out the historical context of the parallel development of contemporary millennial and conspiracist discourse, and his case studies &#8211; Whitley Streiber, David Icke, David Wilcock, and their audiences. Discussion then turns to the meat of Robertson&#8217;s theoretical conclusions concerning epistemic capital, popular epistemic strategies, the UFO as a discursive object connecting two fields of discourse, power, and prophecy. The interview concludes with discussion of the relevance of this field of study to Religious Studies more broadly, and some challenging admonitions to for the discipline.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">Support the RSP by using our affiliate link to buy </span><a style=\"font-size: inherit;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Books-Conspiracy-Theories-Bloomsbury-Advances-Religious/dp/1474253202/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462748973&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=UFOs%2C+Conspiracy+Theories+and+the+New+Age\">David Robertson&#8217;s new book!</a></p>\n",

McGrath was recorded but then fell into a metaphorical black hole (i.e. the potential podcast series never debuted). Fortunately, his discussion of topics including the soul, the religious ethics of artificial intelligence, and the function of science fiction on informing audiences&#8217; spiritual sensibilities all remain (relatively) timeless. To start, he addresses the unique challenges of working across disciplines in pursuit of analyzing popular culture currently, then shifts to an exploration of religion&#8217;s study in the future. Along the way, McGrath and interviewer A. David Lewis namecheck famous characters such as Captain Kirk and Doctor Who in the effort to illustrate complex notions of the soul embedded in secular entertainments. Enjoy a trip to the past—that looks to the future!</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Religious conversion has traditionally been understood as the abandonment of one religious identity for another, or a switch from no religious identification to a newly religious one. Psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, and others have viewed conversion as a sudden, singular event in one’s life. In the 1960s and 1970s, in the wake of new religious movements and the flowering of Asian religious traditions in the West, sociologists reformulated conversion as an active, gradual process of transformation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/41MmGAJ9e1L._SX327_BO1204203200_-198x300.jpg\" alt=\"41MmGAJ9e1L._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_\" width=\"198\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>Conversion, in these understandings, is not a changed subjective or ontological identity but rather a shift in one’s discursive universe, social relationships, and embodied practices, a new role learned through language, behavior, and interpersonal boundary maintenance. Similarly, deconversion and its scholarly synonyms (apostasy, alienation, disaffiliation, defection, exit, leaving) has many contexts, motivations, and processes, including loss of a specific religious experience, doubt or denial of beliefs, moral criticism, emotional suffering, and unlearning particular vocabularies and behaviors.</p>\n<p>For this interview with <a href=\"https://jewishstudies.ku.edu/lynn-davidman\">Lynn Davidman</a>, we focus on the concepts of conversion and deconversion*, illustrations of these processes in various contexts, what each term means and how each is experienced in someone&#8217;s life, the histories of these terms and their use in scholarship, and issues that arise from their conceptualization or use.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_432\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-9035-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-180-Davidman.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-180-Davidman.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-180-Davidman.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-180-Davidman.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=9035-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-180-Davidman.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP-180-Davidman.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('9035-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_9035-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_9035-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_433&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-9035-2&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-180-Davidman.mp3?_=2&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-180-Davidman.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-180-Davidman.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

Roughly 100,000 years prior to Franklin’s quote the first evidence of intentional human burial appears in the archaeological record (Mithen, 2009). Humans have been thinking about death for a very long time and the threat of nonexistence can be a<a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2014/10/31/halloween-special-religions-role-in-terror-management-theory-by-robert-b-arrowood/\"> terrifying</a> reality to face. According to terror management theory (TMT), cultural worldviews, which can manifest religious, political, or a bricolage of other meanings, serve to assuage this fear of our ever impending demise (Jong &amp; Halberstadt, forthcoming). Interestingly, this TMT triage care for the existential self occurs <i>outside of</i> conscious awareness. However, in this podcast interview with Thomas Coleman for the Religious Studies Project, death researcher and psychologist<a href=\"http://jonathanjong.net/\"> Dr. Jonathan Jong</a>, draws on experimental research as he teases the fear of death and the religious worldviews that may help confront this fear, <i>into</i> your conscious awareness.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_436\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-8960-5\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-178-Jonathan-Jong.mp3?_=5\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-178-Jonathan-Jong.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-178-Jonathan-Jong.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-178-Jonathan-Jong.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=8960-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-178-Jonathan-Jong.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP-178-Jonathan-Jong.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('8960-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_8960-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_8960-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_437&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-8960-6&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-178-Jonathan-Jong.mp3?_=6&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-178-Jonathan-Jong.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-178-Jonathan-Jong.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

Music has been a big part of this new emerging &#8220;mediapolois&#8221;, moving from a mostly stand-alone medium, to part of a marketing matrix of  people, places and industries. Today, music&#8217;s meaning is more often part of a branded ecosystem, not limited to entertainment, but part of the experience of everyday life, including religion. Evangelical churches and, increasingly, New Religious Movements use music as part of a branding exercise that helps to transform them from local congregations into a transnational enterprise.</p>\n<p>To discuss music, marketing and contemporary religion, David Robertson sat down with <a href=\"http://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/reid-school-of-music/tom-wagner\">Dr. Tom Wagner</a>, an ethnomusicologist, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rybN78LvuQs\">percussionist</a> and lecturer at the Reid School of Music in Edinburgh. They discuss the long history of the use of music in promoting evangelical congregations, and the transformation that came with the development of recording and broadcast technologies. Tom describes his research and fieldwork with Hillsong, an evangelical church movement with an international reach who use music both in their worship and their branding. Later, they discuss the use of music in Scientology, to create and maintain a particular aesthetic, and how Tom sees this research developing in the future.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_438\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-8641-7\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-177-Tom-Wagner.mp3?_=7\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-177-Tom-Wagner.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-177-Tom-Wagner.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-177-Tom-Wagner.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=8641-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-177-Tom-Wagner.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP-177-Tom-Wagner.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('8641-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_8641-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_8641-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_439&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-8641-8&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-177-Tom-Wagner.mp3?_=8&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-177-Tom-Wagner.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RSP-177-Tom-Wagner.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

Ranging from the first expedition of the conquistador Francisco de Orellana, to the establishment of Jesuit missions across the Marañon river, and the naturalistic explorations of Humboldt and la Condamine, it still feels as if it has more to be known.</p>\n<p>This was also the case for the earliest &#8216;ethnographic&#8217;&nbsp;records of&nbsp;Gaspar de Carvajal and Francisco de Figueroa . As was often the case with Spanish chroniclers, they &#8216;misunderstood&#8217; the &#8216;indigenous&#8217; way of thinking, in some cases even labeling them as atheists (Regan: 2015). In time, this would change, in part because of the continuing social interaction&nbsp;(between missionaries, laymen, other indigenous groups, and so on) but also in more recent times, because of the ethnographic research undertaken&nbsp;by many different anthropologists. This has enabled a more comprehensive knowledge about the beliefs and way of life of the Amazonian indigenous people. In this podcast,&nbsp;Dr Jaime Regan Mainville, a leading researcher in the anthropology of religion and linguistics,&nbsp;discusses his ethnographic research among&nbsp;some of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon basin; namely the kukama, the awajún, and the wampís, among others.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_442\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-8590-11\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RSP-175-James-Regan-Mainville.mp3?_=11\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RSP-175-James-Regan-Mainville.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RSP-175-James-Regan-Mainville.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RSP-175-James-Regan-Mainville.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=8590-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RSP-175-James-Regan-Mainville.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP-175-James-Regan-Mainville.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('8590-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_8590-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_8590-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_443&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-8590-12&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RSP-175-James-Regan-Mainville.mp3?_=12&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RSP-175-James-Regan-Mainville.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RSP-175-James-Regan-Mainville.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>Regan argues that&nbsp;one particular&nbsp;characteristic of Amazonian &nbsp;belief is highlighted above the rest: close links with the environment. Amazonian&nbsp;identity and belief systems are articulated into what Philippe Descola and other anthropologists have regarded as <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-graham-harvey-on-animism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">animism</a>&nbsp;(Regan: 2015).&nbsp;Of course, these beliefs haven&#8217;t remained &#8216;untouched&#8217;&nbsp;or &#8216;pure&#8217;, but have been particularly influenced by encounters with Jesuits and Franciscans during the sixteenth century. The interview continues to focus upon some of the&nbsp;impacts of this these encounters upon existing belief systems, practices and cosmologies&nbsp;(cf. Regan: 2001).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-8597\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/remate-libro-a-la-sombra-de-los-cerros-las-raices-513001-MPE20264898860_032015-F-1-215x300.jpg\" alt=\"remate-libro-a-la-sombra-de-los-cerros-las-raices-513001-MPE20264898860_032015-F (1)\" width=\"215\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/remate-libro-a-la-sombra-de-los-cerros-las-raices-513001-MPE20264898860_032015-F-1-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/remate-libro-a-la-sombra-de-los-cerros-las-raices-513001-MPE20264898860_032015-F-1-768x1072.jpg 768w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/remate-libro-a-la-sombra-de-los-cerros-las-raices-513001-MPE20264898860_032015-F-1-734x1024.jpg 734w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/remate-libro-a-la-sombra-de-los-cerros-las-raices-513001-MPE20264898860_032015-F-1.jpg 860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px\" />In the final part of the interview Regan states that the indigenous way of life has drastically changed, because of the Peruvian state&#8217;s oil exploration policy s, combined with illegal mining and logging. For example, in the case of oil exploration, in June 2009 the “Baguazo” or Bagua conflict took place in part due to failed attempts at consultation and negotiation between with indigenous leaders of the Amazon region (mostly awajún and wampís) and the Peruvian state:&nbsp;Regan traces this to&nbsp;a conflict of worldviews (Regan: 2010).</p>\n<p>Listeners might also be interested in our previous podcasts on <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/of-demons-saints-and-heaven-andean-religious-beliefs-in-peru/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andean Religion in Peru</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-marion-bowman-on-vernacular-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vernacular Religion</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/the-uses-of-indigenous-religion-an-interview-with-bjorn-ola-tafjord/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">category of &#8220;indigenous religion&#8221;</a>.&nbsp;You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

In this interview with University of North Carolina at Greensboro Associate Professor Greg Grieve, video games are presented as a content moving from the margins to the center of the intersection of religion and popular culture. Grieve explains how he integrates play and critical analysis into his course, and narrates the process by which his university&#8217;s library created a space to support his innovative classroom work. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=therelistudpr-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0253012538\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-carole-cusack-on-invented-religions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">invented religions</a>, allow users to create and experience virtual religious spaces, and much more. Students often come to video games in need to critical tools to move beyond play to critical thinking with/about games, but Grieve&#8217;s laboratory methods create miniature experimental situations for students to assess gaming content alongside the gaming experience. Like many other technical tools, games in the classroom require not just some elements of hardware but also new techniques, methods, and theoretical models. This is challenging, yes, but in Greive&#8217;s opinion the hurdles are well-worth the results: invested students, powerful classroom experiences, and content that is as diverse and rich as any other popular culture materials.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_450\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-8450-19\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Grieve-1.mp3?_=19\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Grieve-1.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Grieve-1.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Grieve-1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=8450-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Grieve-1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"Grieve-1.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('8450-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_8450-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_8450-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_451&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-8450-20&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Grieve-1.mp3?_=20&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Grieve-1.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Grieve-1.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>This interview was recorded at the 2015 AAR Conference in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>\n<p><strong>**We are aware that the audio quality this week is not up to our usual standards, but we hope that the content of the interview more than makes up for this.

She goes on to introduce the topic of reincarnation, noting that only recently has CSR paid much attention to these types of beliefs. While conceptual scaffolding surrounding the idea of reincarnation can vary widely from culture to culture, Dr. White draws on some of her recent research pointing out that many similarities exist in how individuals reason about and discern the pre-rebirth identities of the reincarnated. In closing, Dr. White shares some preliminary insights gathered from her ethnography of “past-life groups” in the western United States. Interested in why some individuals may be attracted to these groups, she suggests the groups may function as a form of psychotherapy and self-actualization for those attending.</span></p>\n<p>Listeners may also be interested in our previous podcasts on <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/religion-and-memory-an-interview-with-alexandra-grieser/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Religion and Memory</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-armin-geertz-on-cognitive-approaches-to-the-study-of-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cognitive Approaches to the Study of Religion</a>.&nbsp;You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

The linguistic turn took longer to influence Religious Studies than many other areas of the social sciences, but in recent years this approach has produced some hugely influential works which challenge many of the traditional assumptions of the field. In this interview recorded at the 2015 IAHR Congress in Erfurt, Kocku von Stuckrad tells David G. Robertson how discursive approaches might help solve the challenges of contemporary Religious Studies: the crisis of representation; the situated observer; and the dilemma of essentialism and relativism.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_460\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-8066-29\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RSP162-von-Stuckrad.mp3?_=29\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RSP162-von-Stuckrad.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RSP162-von-Stuckrad.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RSP162-von-Stuckrad.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=8066-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RSP162-von-Stuckrad.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP162-von-Stuckrad.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('8066-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_8066-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_8066-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_461&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-8066-30&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RSP162-von-Stuckrad.mp3?_=30&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RSP162-von-Stuckrad.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RSP162-von-Stuckrad.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/the-critical-study-of-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bruce Lincoln</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/social-constructionism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Titus Hjelm</a>, and feature essays by <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2015/11/12/in-praise-of-polyvocality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ethan Quillen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2014/06/19/on-the-outside-looking-in-western-appropriations-of-eastern-subtle-body-discourse-by-david-gordon-white/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Gordon White</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2015/10/08/world-religions-in-academia-and-the-loci-of-tradition-in-irish-paganisms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Martin Lepage</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2015/01/22/african-christian-fake-explorations-in-religious-authenticity-by-emily-stratton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emily Stratton</a>,&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2015/04/02/but-mountains-dammit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Craig Martin</a>.

As for sex, it is mostly understood as something biological, set by a binary opposition between men and women. But how does this intersect with the study of religion? How do these categories influence the ways in which we look at religion? What is the role of religious institutions in this promotion of the gender binary? What about sexual orientation? What connections can we make between identities, the body and emotions in religious contexts?</p>\n<p>In this interview, Dr. <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/mary-jo-neitz/\">Mary Jo Neitz</a> continues the conversation about religion and gender by focusing on theories from LGBT studies and queer studies. Using her work as an ethnographer, as well as the work of American philosopher Judith Butler, Neitz distinguishes the categories of gender and sex by showing how performance and experiences are at the heart of the social construction of gender and sexual identities. Neitz also discusses the role of religious institutions and practices in the agency experienced by some of her informants, as well as the place of the body and essentialist politics in the study of religion.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_462\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-7345-31\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RSP161-Neitz.mp3?_=31\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RSP161-Neitz.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RSP161-Neitz.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RSP161-Neitz.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=7345-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RSP161-Neitz.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP161-Neitz.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('7345-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_7345-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_7345-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_463&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-7345-32&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RSP161-Neitz.mp3?_=32&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RSP161-Neitz.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RSP161-Neitz.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>Listeners might also be interested in our previous interviews with <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/lived-religion-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meredith McGuire</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-marta-trzebiatowska-on-why-women-are-more-religion-than-men/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marta Trzebiatowska</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/religion-gender-and-corporeality/\">Anna Fedele</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-lisbeth-mikaelsson-on-religion-and-gender/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lizbeth Mikaelsson</a>, and feature essays by <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/09/19/why-are-women-more-social-than-men-by-erika-salomon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erika Salomon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2015/10/15/gender-as-lived-considerations-in-ethnographic-methodology/\">Claire Miller Skriletz</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/05/23/george-ioannides-double-trouble-some-reflections-on-engendering-the-study-of-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">George Ioannides</a>.

U.S. religious demographers rely on privately-funded surveys, such as the General Social Survey (GSS), the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS), Pew’s Religious Landscape Survey, Baylor Religion Survey, and Gallup polls, among others, for large-scale nationally representative data on religion. Sherkat evaluates the reliability of various surveys as well as the quality of the data on non-Christian populations in the U.S., given that the vast majority of respondents self-identify as Christians or as “nones.” <img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-ariela-keysar/\" target=\"_blank\">demography (Ariela Keysar), <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/abby-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">belief and belonging (Abby Day)</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-identity-or-identification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">identity and identification (with the Culture on the Edge group)</a>.

    "content": "<p>What happens when two vastly different civilizations meet each other? History tells us that on the one hand, they could make war or, on the other, begin to establish kinship or state alliances. The colonization process of Peru is one that had a lot of the first, and a bit of the second. Just as the people came to conflict, so did their gods. However, the local gods who lost this conflict did not vanish in oblivion, but remained in other forms, even in some places in their original one.</p>\n<p>In his interview with Sidney Castillo, Dr. Luis Millones discusses some of the traditions that have formed the basis for his research, particularly in the northern coast, northern highlands and south highlands of Peru. He mentions that, with the impact of colonization, many of the <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/the-uses-of-indigenous-religion-an-interview-with-bjorn-ola-tafjord/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">indigenous beliefs</a> were replaced or mixed (to some extent), in order to facilitate the installation of a status quo that incorporated many of the ethnic groups’s beliefs (among other, more &#8216;earthly&#8217; institutions) that were present prior to the Spaniards&#8217; arrival (Millones 2005). And this is when when different traditions emerge commonly know as folklore (see also <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-marion-bowman-on-vernacular-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vernacular religion</a>).</p>\n<p>Ranging from different conceptions of the devil &#8211; less as a punisher and more as a trickster (Millones &amp;

In fact, we tend to take the connection between secularity and the academy completely for granted. But was this always the case? If not, how did it become so? And what does secular mean in this context? In this interview recorded at the 2015 IAHR Congress in Erfurt, Tomoko Masuzawa tells David G. Robertson how the medieval university was transformed — first through the introduction of the collegiate system in the 1700s, which gave private donors a say in who could study, and then again in the late 19th Century, with the Berlin model being exported throughout Europe and the colonies. What we discover is not a dialogue between the religious and the secular, but between different Christian sects. What does this say about our present-day academic endeavours?</p>\n",

When it comes to intersecting the study of religion and the study of gender, it is crucial to be aware of the categories used by the informants in order to leave the power they have gained in their experience of womanhood, motherhood and procreation in their own hands. If religion has often been perceived as something that regulates gender and sexuality, it is also a great locus of power for those who interact with it through bodily experiences and embodied practices. Fedele goes on to say that, in order to fully grasp the complexity of her informants, certain changes need to happen in the study of religion, with the use of methodologies surrounding life stories, and also in the opposing categories of insider and outsider.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_474\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-7343-43\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RSP154-Fedele.mp3?_=43\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RSP154-Fedele.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RSP154-Fedele.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RSP154-Fedele.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=7343-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RSP154-Fedele.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP154-Fedele.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('7343-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_7343-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_7343-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_475&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-7343-44&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RSP154-Fedele.mp3?_=44&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RSP154-Fedele.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RSP154-Fedele.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>This interview was recorded at the 2015 ISSR Conference, Université catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. Listeners might also be interested in our previous interviews with <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/lived-religion-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meredith McGuire</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-marta-trzebiatowska-on-why-women-are-more-religion-than-men/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marta Trzebiatowska</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-lisbeth-mikaelsson-on-religion-and-gender/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lizbeth Mikaelsson</a>, and feature essays by <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/09/19/why-are-women-more-social-than-men-by-erika-salomon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erika Salomon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/05/23/george-ioannides-double-trouble-some-reflections-on-engendering-the-study-of-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">George Ioannides</a>. You can download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

Arguably, both the seeming academic disregard and popular fascination with this topic are indicative of a superficial understanding of the broad range of phenomena to which the designation ‘Pagan’ can refer.

This can be seen, as shown in one chapter of her book, within gendered spiritualities, as much as in the way she approaches the object of her studies.</p>\n<p>In this interview, McGuire draws on her vast experiences on the field to talk about how religion is an embodied phenomenon that ultimately can&#8217;t be separated from the cognitive and the social. She also touches on issues of authenticity, normativity and authority in religious and ritual contexts, as well as important methodological aspects of her research.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_480\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-7347-49\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RSP152-McGuire.mp3?_=49\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RSP152-McGuire.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RSP152-McGuire.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RSP152-McGuire.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=7347-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RSP152-McGuire.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP152-McGuire.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('7347-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_7347-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_7347-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_481&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-7347-50&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RSP152-McGuire.mp3?_=50&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RSP152-McGuire.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RSP152-McGuire.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/martin-lepage/\">Martin</a> and Meredith.

Carroll, like many of his generation, emigrated to the US in the early part of the 20th century. On crossing the US, his trajectory onward to south Asia became entangled more deeply with the politics of empire and colonialism.</p>\n<p>Dhammaloka&#8217;s story opens up a people&#8217;s history of the development of Buddhism in what we might call the West. The crossing of boundaries, which we see in the monk&#8217;s biography, points to a number of ideas around the identification of religion with nationalist projects. These are challenges to imperial authorities and is bound up in Dhammaloka&#8217;s conversion to, and acceptance by, everyday Buddhism in Burma.</p>\n<p>I<img class=\" alignleft\" src=\"http://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1138789585&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" />n this story is a continuation of &#8220;dissident orientalism&#8221;, a conflict inherent within the colonial project wherein communities and personal trajectories become embedded within local religious contexts. A distinction made, both in Ireland and Burma, between native religion and the religion of the coloniser serves only to enhance the connection between nationalist movements and ethno-religious identity. Cox&#8217;s ideas focus on the conjunctions between race, religion and imperial power.

    "content": "<p>The fact that not only do religious believers sometimes question, struggle with, or even doubt their beliefs, but that resolving these issues can lead someone to a greater level of acceptance and understanding of their faith has been embodied in the form of quest-orientation for some time (Batson &amp; Ventis, 1982). But recently, researchers studying the psychology of religion and spirituality have become more interested in how these spiritual stuggles might also lead towards distress as well (Exline, Pargament, Grubbs, &amp; Yali, 2014). But are these struggles <em>only</em> experienced by the &#8216;religious&#8217; about &#8216;religious&#8217; beliefs? Or could people, even nonbelievers, also experience analogous struggles which impact their lives, for both good and bad.</p>\n<p>In this podcast, psychologist Dr. Julie Exline talks about her work in developing the <em>Religious and Spiritual Struggles scale</em>, where the original ideas came from and how they interacted with her previous work surrounding anger towards god (Exline, Park, Smyth, &amp; Carey, 2011). She then goes on to describe how some interesting findings within her previous work led her to be interested in whether or not nonbelievers experience similar &#8216;spiritual&#8217; struggles, if they could be measured and compared to believers’ struggles, and how to measure them in a way valid for both believers and nonbelievers. She also gives a brief overview of some of her current work and interests in the area of nonbelief and secularity more broadly.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_486\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-7115-55\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP149-Exline.mp3?_=55\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP149-Exline.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP149-Exline.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP149-Exline.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=7115-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP149-Exline.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP149-Exline.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('7115-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_7115-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_7115-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_487&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-7115-56&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP149-Exline.mp3?_=56&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP149-Exline.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP149-Exline.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

Further, Dr. Galen covers recent priming studies that suggest both religious and secular primes achieve equal ends in terms of behavioral monitoring.

As the primary architect of a unique version of conservative protestantism referred to as Christian Reconstructionism, Rushdoony worked for several decades to implement Old Testament Biblical law in contemporary America. Though he never realized his vision, and though his movement largely died with him, Rushdoony remains an important figure because his comparably extreme vision for Christian America challenged contemporary conservatives on a number of religious and theological issues and helped pull them farther to the political right</p>\n<p>In this interview, Professor Michael McVicar discusses Rushdoony and Christian Reconstruction.

When race is included at all, it is often conflated with ethnicity or else its study is limited to a few typical examples, such as black/white binaries, the “Black church” or various “ethnic churches,” or the racialization of Muslim minorities. In this interview, Rudy Busto discusses problems and possibilities in the study of race and religion: how it has been examined (and overlooked) in the field of religious studies, how it has been confused with ethnicity, how race and religion have been theorized as mutually constitutive, limitations and occlusions in the study of race and religion, and why race is a category scholars of religion cannot afford to ignore. The racial/religious co-constitution of collective identities is an ever-present double-marked boundary which produces real effects on actual bodies, an empirical fact structuring people’s experiences. As such, scholars render their scholarship incomplete and do a disservice to their students and readers when they ignore race. Ranging from work on the social construction of race and religion as scholarly categories, the challenges of analyzing syncretism and authenticity, and the necessity of highlighting unmarked categories (e.g., Protestant, white), Busto argues that it is impossible to get an accurate and comprehensive understanding of religion (and non-religion) without taking race into account.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_492\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-7009-61\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP146-Busto.mp3?_=61\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP146-Busto.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP146-Busto.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP146-Busto.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=7009-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP146-Busto.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP146-Busto.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('7009-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_7009-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_7009-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_493&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-7009-62&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP146-Busto.mp3?_=62&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP146-Busto.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RSP146-Busto.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

While most of the physical and technical conflict took place overseas, political and ideological battles were waged within the United States.</p>\n<p>Some of these Americans died, as it were, by their own hand.

While LaPorte himself described his act of protest as a specifically religious act, the validity of this description would soon be—and remain—contested, finding opposition among the Catholic hierarchy. The attention of U.S. media gave the contestation of martyrdom a public arena.</p>\n<p>In this interview, postdoctoral researcher of U.S. Catholicism, Francesca Cadeddu, shares some of her reflections on LaPorte, whose contested martyrdom by self-immolation is the topic of her present postdoctoral project.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_498\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6884-67\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RSP143-caddadu.mp3?_=67\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RSP143-caddadu.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RSP143-caddadu.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RSP143-caddadu.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6884-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RSP143-caddadu.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP143-caddadu.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6884-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6884-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6884-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_499&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6884-68&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RSP143-caddadu.mp3?_=68&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RSP143-caddadu.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RSP143-caddadu.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "content": "\n<p>Actions typically speak louder than words. A common version of this statement &#8211; <i>practice what you preach</i> – is a popular conversational quip, used by the religious and nonreligious alike to scoff hypocrites. In short, action codifies our cognitive sentiments – our beliefs. It is one thing to say you believe and quite another to act “as if” you believe. We typically take some actions (e.g. going to a church) to both entail, and lend credence to certain beliefs (e.g. believing in the Christian God), as opposed to others (e.g. not believing in a god, or believing in Allah). Nonetheless it is quite possible to attend church or participate in ritual without holding belief in a God or gods (c.f. Silver, Coleman, Hood &amp; Holcombe, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13674676.2014.987743#/doi/abs/10.1080/13674676.2014.987743\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2014</a>). Importantly however, acting on our beliefs only lends <a href=\"http://www.hecc.ubc.ca/files/2012/07/evolution-of-costly-displays-_henrich-2009.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CRED</a>ibility to them, and not veridicality. Conversely, failing to act on a professed belief has the potential to undermine the credibility of said belief (CRUDs): if it is important to attend church, but no one goes – is it really that important to attend? Moreover, if no one is going to church, maybe belief in God is not that important after all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the past research in the cognitive sciences of religion (CSR) has dealt primarily with how abstract symbols (minimally counterintuitive content (MCI); e.g. a talking mouse or invisible entities that can communicate with you) are processed by our mental architecture, and easily transmitted within populations due to their conceptual <i>shape</i> (for a critical review see, Purzycki &amp; Willard, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/the-burning-saints-fire-walking-rituals-of-the-anastenaria-an-interview-with-dimitris-xygalatas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> practices</a> what they preach (both in and out of the religious domain), they may be seen as credible sources with which to acquire further information from (Henrich, 2009; Lanman, 2012). In this&nbsp;interview with Thomas Coleman, Dr. Jonathan Lanman highlights the role that public displays of commitment (CREDs &amp; CRUDs) play in the <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/1590808/The_Importance_of_Religious_Displays_for_Belief_Acquisition_and_Secularization\">acquisition</a> of both belief and nonbelief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Lanman begins by discussing his research interests and some of the current work underway at the <a href=\"http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/InstituteofCognitionCulture/\">Institute of Cognition and Culture</a>. Next, he explains both content and context biases, and briefly outlines the notion of dual-inheritance theory. Importantly, Lanman goes on to emphasize how actions (CREDs), and failing to act (CRUDs), may contribute to the varying levels of religiosity seen throughout the world. In closing, Lanman suggests that while content biases are important for the transmission of religious concepts, they always occur in a given context: “upon initial evidence…[CREDs/CRUDs are] one of the most important factors in determining who ends up a theist and who ends up a nontheist.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>References</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Silver, C.

Although focus is often placed on divisions between Sunni and Shi’a communities, one of the most fascinating modalities of belonging within Islam is that of Sufism, all the more interesting because Sufi sensibilities can extend across the full spectrum of Muslim identities. Sufism is often defined as a “mystical” tradition that shares similarities with forms of mysticism from other traditions in the way that in conceptualizes the nature of divinity and the nature of human understanding.</p>\n<p>In this interview, Milad Milani discusses the basic orientation and history of Sufi thought. He also speaks about the diverse national variations of Sufism, particularly with respect to Iranian (or “Persianate”) Sufism. The interview concludes with a few critical remarks on the questionable appropriation of Sufism in contemporary Western discourses on religion.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_500\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6873-69\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP141-milani.mp3?_=69\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP141-milani.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP141-milani.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP141-milani.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6873-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP141-milani.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP141-milani.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6873-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6873-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6873-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_501&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6873-70&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP141-milani.mp3?_=70&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP141-milani.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP141-milani.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

He then taught for many years at the University of Minnesota before he returned to the University of Chicago’s Divinity School, where he is the Caroline E. Haskell Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions. According to his biography on the University of Chicago’s website, “His research tends to focus on the religions of pre-Christian Europe and pre-Islamic Iran, but he has a notoriously short attention span and has also written on a bewildering variety of topics, including Guatemalan curanderismo, Lakota sun dances, Melanesian funerary rituals, Swazi kingship, the Saint Bartholomew&#8217;s Day massacre, Marco Polo, professional wrestling, Persian imperialism, the theology of George W. Bush, and comparative demonology.” What underlying theme or methodology holds together this diverse body of work?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright\"><img src=\"http://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0226482030&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As Dr. Lincoln discusses in this interview, he is interested in the constructed nature of society. “I think society is a project,” he said, “rather than an entity that exists by nature.” From this foundation, Lincoln isolates a variety of specific instances in multiple places and times where people appeal to religious discourse to legitimate their local interests. Religion, for Lincoln, is a thoroughly human phenomenon. To demonstrate this, it requires the type of critically-informed analysis that Lincoln seldom finds in the academic study of religion.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Do you believe that unseen forces have the causal power to move physical objects and intervene in everyday human affairs? Of course you do. You are probably like most other humans alive today who effortlessly place great explanatory weight on these hidden forces. However, such unseen forces are not the local forest spirits, or gods in the sky, per se, but as Gervais (2013, p. 380) writes: “These entities are called minds”. Conversely, it just so happens that we attribute to the forest spirit, to the gods, and even to the Christian God (Barrett &amp; Keil, 1996) for example, a mind that has the same conceptual limitations as our own (e.g. being limited in action by both time and space). A core tenet of cognitive science of religion (CSR) is that the folk-psychological ability to explain human behavior in terms of beliefs, desires and intentions – known as theory of mind (ToM) – is also a system that makes us receptive to belief in the supernatural (Banerjee &amp; Bloom, 2013; Gervais, 2013). But why?</p>\n<p>In his interview with Thomas Coleman, cultural and evolutionary psychologist Dr. <a href=\"http://beliefandmoralitylab.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Will Gervais</a> talks about the role that ToM plays in explaining both belief, and nonbelief in supernatural agents. Gervais begins by discussing some of his prior research in the field, and draws salient the various phenomena that falls under the ability, he terms as “mind perception”. Further, he touches on how, and why ToM is an important construct in CSR for explaining god beliefs, and gives the listener insight into how unseen mental states can be measured.* In closing, Gervais answers important questions such as “Is ToM a religion specific system?” and even weighs in on the suggested autism-atheism connection prevalent in CSR.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_504\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6772-73\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP138-gervais.mp3?_=73\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP138-gervais.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP138-gervais.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP138-gervais.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6772-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP138-gervais.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP138-gervais.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6772-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6772-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6772-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_505&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6772-74&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP138-gervais.mp3?_=74&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP138-gervais.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RSP138-gervais.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>A short video clip of Heider and Simmel’s classic 1944 experiment mentioned in the podcast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9TWwG4SFWQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">can be found here</a>. You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

In this interview, Titus Hjelm tells David Robertson about social constructionism &#8211; that is, a set of approaches which see social realities as built from language, rather than reflecting ontological realities. Hjelm outlines how these approaches emerged as part of the &#8216;linguistic turn&#8217; in the social sciences more broadly, as well as pointing to some different interpretations of how these constructivist, discursive or critical approaches operate. Their importance, he suggests, is in challenging how we think about ontology, epistemology and power.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/russell-mccutcheon-on-religion-as-sui-generis/\" />sui generis thing-in-itself, rather than a product of human culture.

In this interview with Molly H. Bassett, <a href=\"http://religiousstudies.gsu.edu/profile/molly-bassett/\">Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia</a>, listeners are treated to a glimpse of a society where human sacrifice was a tool for encountering the divine, priests turned into gods and goddesses, and death held radical meanings for religious agents.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the interview, Dr. Bassett shares how she became involved in Mesoamerican studies thanks to her mentor, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carrasco\">Davíd Carrasco</a>. “Hardly anybody… in religious studies” works in this area, she says, instead they are in allied fields such as anthropology or history. Stressing the power of mentors on her career, Bassett reminds all scholars of the role a devoted teacher can have on one’s life. And, as the interview unfolds, the value of this disciplinarity is on display as Bassett is able to ask different questions of the Aztec sources than previous scholars have been.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_510\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6756-79\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RSP135-bassett.mp3?_=79\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RSP135-bassett.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RSP135-bassett.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RSP135-bassett.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6756-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RSP135-bassett.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP135-bassett.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6756-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6756-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6756-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_511&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6756-80&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RSP135-bassett.mp3?_=80&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RSP135-bassett.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RSP135-bassett.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>After providing an overview of the many shared features of pre-Columbian cultures from Southern Texas all the way to Honduras that became known as Mesoamerican thanks to the work of ethnologist Paul Kirchhoff. Stepped pyramids, pictographic writing, ballgames, sacrifice, and common linguistic families are just a few of the traits that reveal the roots of this cultural area. Bassett’s work has included a focus on linguistics and especially through the study of texts employing pictograms (sound and symbols) as in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentine_Codex\"><i>Florentine Codex</i></a> and <i>Codex Mexicanus</i>. The <i>Florentine Codex </i>was composed by spanish speaker missionaries who encountered Aztecs, and then learned and translated Nahuatl into Spanish with the help of tri-lingual scribes into volumes that contained both text and commentary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0292760884/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0292760884&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21&amp;linkId=DPL6ZZKJEQGG3I3V\"><img class=\" alignleft\" src=\"http://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0292760884&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=therelistudpr-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0292760884\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" />One of the most fascinating elements of these early codices is its portrayal of Spanish conquistador Cortez’ encounter with Aztec leader Montezuma. Bassett’s work on this encounter, especially in her recently published <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0292760884/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0292760884&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21&amp;linkId=P3LMSCW2HMNNRJTI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Fate of Earthly Things</a>, argues that the codices present this ritual occasion as one where the Spanish were presented as “teotl” or gods. For scholars this has been a challenging interpretative moment. Did the Aztecs <i>really </i>think the Spaniards were gods? No, says Bassett, and by asking <i>what </i>the Aztecs meant by “<i>teotl</i>” she reveals the potency of <i>teixiptla</i> or local embodiments of god(s). Montezuma, she claims, may have used the gift exchange with the Spaniards as a way to prepare Cortez for sacrifice and transformation into a<i> teixiptla</i>.</p>\n<p>By the end of the interview, Bassett comes to articulate the value of Mesoamerican studies for undergraduate and graduate students. Her own experiences coming to establish material from a religious studies’ perspective suggest the importance of discipline and method in defining the questions we can ask and therefore the answers our subjects can provide. In the classroom her graduate students&#8211;often not even Americanists and rarely Mesoamericanists&#8211;are challenged by this material, especially by primary materials that have been approached by methods from different disciplines. For many scholars who teach method or theory courses, Bassett’s presentation of a primary source and the way different disciplines’ methods can limit or expand our inquiries is an excellent model for teachers in all areas and subjects.</p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

Every month readers can expect another installment of their favorite comic on the shelves. Characters facing insurmountable odds will find a way to victory. Nemeses will be defeated. And should a hero die, they are likely to be re-born. In some sense, to be a hero is to be immortal. Even extraordinary humans such as Bruce Wayne (Batman), find their identities preserved for all time by turning the secret hero’s mask into a mantle to be bequeathed on worthy successors. One widespread trope has been much ignored by comic fans and scholars&#8211;the journey to the afterlife. Like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabasis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">katabasis</a> or descent into the Underworld of Orpheus, Odysseus, Gilgamesh, Theseus, and dozens of other mythical figures, modern comic book superheroes routinely journey to heaven, hell, and other landscapes of the afterlife.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/3895/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A. David Lewis</a>, comic books are presented as an irreplaceable cultural medium for engaging with issues of mortality, identity, subjectivity, and cosmology. In the pages of comic books, Lewis explains, the popular elements of the journey to the afterlife become surfaces upon which can be written a kind of “special reality” whose artificiality makes it possible for readers (and writers) to have discussions about serious issues but never fully commit to the vision of the comic books. For Lewis, that so many different versions of this journey exist but have yet to be readily acknowledged speaks to the major tensions in western culture. One central concern, he maintains, is the unspoken effort to preserve models of self that are unified. “We don’t want see our selves as multiples,” says Lewis. We want to be unified, “whole individuals.” And yet recent work on healthy multiplicity by Helene T. Russell and J. Hills Miller suggests that by accepting “people [as] constructed by many selves” we can further the work of religious pluralism and enhance inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_512\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6728-81\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP134-comics-afterlife.mp3?_=81\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP134-comics-afterlife.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP134-comics-afterlife.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP134-comics-afterlife.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6728-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP134-comics-afterlife.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP134-comics-afterlife.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6728-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6728-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6728-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_513&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6728-82&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP134-comics-afterlife.mp3?_=82&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP134-comics-afterlife.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP134-comics-afterlife.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-medium wp-image-6730 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/comic-192x300.jpg\" alt=\"comic\" width=\"192\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/comic-192x300.jpg 192w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/comic.jpg 410w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\" />For those who may still see comic books as unworthy material for serious scholarship, A.

As well as a complex cosmology, Gurdjieff taught that the average human being was literally asleep, and that &#8220;waking up&#8221; required a great deal of work and &#8220;conscious suffering&#8221; His work was continued by his pupils following his death in 1949, and a number of books on his teachings remain in print today. To discuss his importance to the study of religion, David Robertson speaks to two remarkable scholars, Carole Cusack of the University of Sydney, and Steven Sutcliffe of the University of Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>We discuss Gurdjieff&#8217;s image&nbsp;as a &#8220;guru&#8221;; how deliberate was it, and where did he learn about the Eastern teachers he modelled himself upon? We discuss how much we should treat Gurdjieff as a <em>sui generis</em> &#8220;special case&#8221;, as Gurdjieffian scholars have tended to, or whether we would be better to treat him as a type, like Blavatksy, Steiner, Crowley and others. This then turns the discussion to the issues of researching figures like Gurdjieff whose legacies (and archives) are tightly controlled by their followers, and who often aren&#8217;t seen as worthy of study by the academy and publishers. We conclude with a consideration of Gurdjieff&#8217;s importance (or lack thereof) on the later New Age milieu, and popular culture more broadly.</p>\n<p>And did Robert Fripp hire Toy Levin for King Crimson because he looks like Gurdjieff?</p>\n<div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5306\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6684-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP133-Gurdjieff.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP133-Gurdjieff.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP133-Gurdjieff.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP133-Gurdjieff.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6684-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP133-Gurdjieff.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP133-Gurdjieff.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6684-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6684-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6684-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5307&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6684-2&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP133-Gurdjieff.mp3?_=2&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP133-Gurdjieff.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP133-Gurdjieff.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p>\n<p>You may enjoy our previous interviews with Carole Cusack on <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/carole-cusack-on-religion-and-cultural-production/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Cultural Production&#8221;</a> and <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-carole-cusack-on-invented-religions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Invented Religions&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "content": "<p>Given its contextual and perspectival malleability, the notion of ‘authority&#8217;, and even more so of ‘religious authority’, is challenging to define and to study. In October 2014, a number of scholars working on both ‘traditional’ and new modes of authority gathered for the<em> Religious Authority in Asia: Problems and Strategies of Recognition</em> workshop, which was funded by the <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/erica-baffelli/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr Erica Baffelli</a> who in today’s interview with Paulina Kolata discusses the notion of authority and charismatic leadership in the context of her research on New and ‘New’ New religions in contemporary Japan.</p>\n<p><img class=\" alignleft\" src=\"http://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0415864909&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" />It seems that the most problematic issue in discussions on authority in the Japanese religious context and beyond is the very recognition and identification of its existence and its impact on communities at trans-national, national and local levels. The assertion of authority can be perceived through the prism of the scholarly discourse on religions, relationships between religious specialists and their supporting communities, and the state-religion interface. There are two watershed dates – 1946 and 1995 – and the events associated with them can be considered as crucial in shaping the socio-economic and political conditions of the religious power struggle in Japanese society in post-war Japan. The first date is linked to the promulgation of the new post-war constitution which sanctioned freedom of religious belief, and separated religion and the state.  The second marks the date of an act of domestic terrorism – the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway – perpetrated by members of new religious group Aum Shinrikyō led by a charismatic figure of Asahara Shōkō. Listen to Erica Baffelli talk charisma, leadership and the media in assertion of religious authority in the context of New Religions in Japan.</p>\n<div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5308\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6650-3\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP132-Baffelli.mp3?_=3\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP132-Baffelli.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP132-Baffelli.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP132-Baffelli.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6650-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP132-Baffelli.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP132-Baffelli.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6650-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6650-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6650-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5309&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6650-4&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP132-Baffelli.mp3?_=4&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP132-Baffelli.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP132-Baffelli.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p>\n<p>Listeners might also be interested in our previous interview with <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/pauline-hope-cheong-on-religious-authority-and-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pauline Hope Cheong on Religious Authority and Social Media</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=therelistudpr-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0415864909\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" />You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

They consider how work like this is important in undermining many of the assumptions that the study of religion is based upon. For example, inasmuch as we tend to think of millennialism in contemporary Britain, it would tend to be in some exclusionary &#8220;cult&#8221;; yet here is an example among apparently ordinary&nbsp;working Christians. It becomes clear that anthropology, when applied to &#8220;ourselves&#8221;, still has the power to make &#8220;the strange familiar, and the familiar strange&#8221; (Muesse, 2011).</p>\n<div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5310\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6596-5\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP131-Webster.mp3?_=5\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP131-Webster.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP131-Webster.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP131-Webster.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6596-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP131-Webster.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP131-Webster.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6596-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6596-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6596-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5311&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6596-6&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP131-Webster.mp3?_=6&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP131-Webster.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RSP131-Webster.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

Pilgrimage developed as a practice available to only a few. The danger of the road, the cost of travel, and restrictions of class and feudal systems made it impossible for the common people to travel to remote sacred places. Similar to the situation in Early Medieval Europe (Sumption 1975: 11-12), political instability in pre-Tokugawa Japan (pre-1603) and an overall hostility to travelling strangers discouraged even some willing pilgrims from visiting many famous sites.  Whether it was wandering Buddhist monks circuiting Medieval Japan and performing healing rituals or Heian-aristocracy visiting Buddhist sites famous for their wish-granting powers, the practice of pilgrimage, and the special benevolence of the deities that went along with it, was reserved for a handful of people who had time and wealth to spare in order to afford the travel and to secure their safety on the dangerous routes.</p>\n<p>Since then, pilgrimage has undergone a number of transitions that have shaped and redefined the way it is practiced and perceived. Various socio-economic and political changes, as well as technological developments, the establishment of modern tourism, and the expansion of the media have changed the way individuals ‘do’ pilgrimage, and shaped scholars’ understandings of modern religious travel, facilitating the transition of pilgrimage from obscure ascetic practice to widely popular touristic activity.</p>\n<p>The element of journey, the importance of material culture, the role of media and technology, as well as the commercialisation of the practice of pilgrimage are dictate the conditions of survival and the popularity of pilgrimage today. Pilgrimage is a vivid representation of the way religion interacts with tourism, as we have seen before in our interview with <a title=\"Alex Norman on Spiritual Tourism\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-alex-norman-on-spiritual-tourism/\">Alex Norman on ‘Spiritual Tourism’</a>. However, the exposure of pilgrimage practice to the influences of tourism and commodification does not necessarily diminish the ‘religious’ or ‘spiritual’ character of the practice. The utilization of the technological advancements of ‘this world’ is an important element in the survival of pilgrimage in Japan and elsewhere, helping it to become a kind of religious ‘pop culture’.</p>\n<p>Within Religious Studies, discussion has rarely focused on the so-called this-worldliness of pilgrimage. Yet,  in October, RSP interviewer Paulina Kolata was able to sit down with Professor Ian Reader to discuss his publication ‘<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00F47542I/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00F47542I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21&amp;linkId=FC64KSEXN2QBTYXV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Pilgrimage in the Marketplace</em></a>’ (October 2013), which explores the very ‘worldly’ conditions of development, popularisation, and ultimately, survival of pilgrimage centres in connection to the dynamics of the marketplace through which the ‘sacred’ as a category can be sustained. In this interview, Ian offers an insight into the meaning of pilgrimage, particularly in the Japanese context, and discusses the competitiveness of the pilgrimage market, the practice’s connection to tourism, playfulness of religion, and the survival of pilgrimage practice. After a fascinating conversation and a couple of cups of coffee later, we hope that listeners will enjoy this podcast as much as Paula and Ian enjoyed recording it, and we look forward to your discussions.</p>\n<div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5314\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6456-9\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP129-Reader-1.mp3?_=9\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP129-Reader-1.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP129-Reader-1.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP129-Reader-1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6456-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP129-Reader-1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP129-Reader-1.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6456-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6456-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6456-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5315&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6456-10&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP129-Reader-1.mp3?_=10&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP129-Reader-1.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP129-Reader-1.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p>\n<p>For ease of listening, we decided to split this interview into two parts.

In this view, the secular was an afterthought, a ‘second-class citizen’ so to speak. However, what happens if the scholarly lens is shifted towards the ‘secular’, with ‘religion’ being placed on the back burner? In Thomas Coleman’s interview for The Religious Studies Project, he sits down with sociologist <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-secular-life\">Phil Zuckerman</a> and philosopher <a href=\"http://shook.pragmatism.org/\">John R. Shook</a> to discuss all things ’secular‘. Making their own contributions to the discourse, Shook and Zuckerman briefly discuss the forthcoming Oxford Handbook of Secularism they are co-editing, the growing field of secular studies, what it might mean to ’be secular‘, different secularisms, and offer up two different views of the relationship between categories such as ’religion‘ and ’secular‘.</p>\n<div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5316\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6487-12\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP128-Secular.mp3?_=12\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP128-Secular.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP128-Secular.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP128-Secular.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6487-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP128-Secular.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP128-Secular.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6487-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6487-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6487-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5317&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6487-13&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP128-Secular.mp3?_=13&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP128-Secular.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP128-Secular.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

Three seemingly simple terms with clear referents. Three categories which – perhaps unsurprisingly, to regular listeners of the RSP – have been, and continue to be, associated with and invoked in support of myriad competing agendas, truth claims, ideologies, and more.</p>\n<p>In telling the story of the complex interrelationship between these terms, some might point to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Conference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Berlin Conference of 1884/5</a> as a defining moment marking the beginning of intensive Euro-American Christian mission to Africa. Others might direct attention to the fact that Christianity has been present in Africa almost since its emergence, with three of the best known figures of the early church – <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_the_Great\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthony</a> (c. 285-356), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_of_Alexandria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athanasius</a> (296-373) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Augustine</a> (354-430) – living and working in the north of the continent. Still others might prefer a more contemporary approach, focusing upon the Christianities that can be discerned among communities of African origin in Diaspora. This week’s podcast focuses upon the latter.</p>\n<p>In this interview with Chris, Dr <a title=\"Afe Adogame\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/afe-adogame/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Afe Adogame</a> of the University of Edinburgh provides a stimulating introduction to this vast and complicated triad.</p>\n<div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5318\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6449-14\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP127-Adogame.mp3?_=14\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP127-Adogame.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP127-Adogame.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP127-Adogame.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6449-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP127-Adogame.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP127-Adogame.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6449-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6449-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6449-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5319&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6449-15&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP127-Adogame.mp3?_=15&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP127-Adogame.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RSP127-Adogame.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p>\n<p>Discussion covers a wide range of questions, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What makes African Christianity &#8216;African&#8217;?

Is there one?</li>\n<li>What does the study of African Christianity &#8211; in the West or elsewhere &#8211; bring to the study of ‘religion’ in general?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\" alignleft\" src=\"http://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1472420101&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=therelistudpr-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=1441136673\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" />This interview was originally conceived as a kind of two-parter with an interview on ‘African Indigenous Traditions in the West’ which has, as yet, not occurred. Of course, it must be stated that ‘Christianity’ and ‘Indigenous Traditions’ are not the full story of ‘religion’ in Africa, with one glaring omission being ‘Islam’ amongst others. However, due to time constraints this interview will focus almost exclusively on ‘Christianity’ and we shall attempt to rectify this in the future.</p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "content": "<p>Over one hundred years ago, William James dedicated an entire chapter in <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em> to “The Reality of the Unseen”. When we typically imagine religion, we imagine that religion has to do with <em>something</em> perceivable, yet paradoxically something that we cannot see, taste, smell, or touch. James characterized the relationship of the individual psyche and belief in the supernatural realm as “…if there were in the human consciousness a sense of reality, <em>a feeling of objective presence, a perception</em> of what we may call ‘<em>something there</em>’…” (1985, p. 55 [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/religion-is-natural-and-science-is-not-an-interview-with-robert-mccauley/\">impulse</a> to believe may be there, one’s relationship to this unseen realm is not easy to cultivate and maintain. Our evolved psychology was not ‘built’ with the intuition that, even though we have <em>minds</em>, there is an unseen &#8211; ultimate <em>mind</em> &#8211; that has access to our own and shares thoughts with us (<a href=\"http://artsci.wustl.edu/~pboyer/PBoyerHomeSite/articles/2013-Boyer-Hau.pdf\">Boyer, 2013</a>). Such ideas require cultural scaffolding, and are not easily sustained in the absence of social systems. Although often ignored, “all our ethnography and history suggests that there is learning involved in the practice of religion…” (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1844657426/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1844657426&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21&amp;linkId=XYMYVMVCCP4BHFFX\">Luhrmann, 2013, p. 147</a>).

Coleman III\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/thomas-j-coleman-iii/\">Thomas Coleman</a>, psychological-anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann discusses her multiyear ethnography of American evangelicals where she sought to understand how some of these individuals come to have close, personal, intimate relationships with God (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0307277275/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0307277275&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21&amp;linkId=QEHMN5N5RZGCOCDN\">Luhrmann, 2012</a>). She begins by providing the background into her extensive research on the Vineyard Church movement, where she attended sermons, house groups, prayer groups, and many other opportunities to understand evangelicals, specifically, how God becomes real for them. Luhrmann details the rise of evangelicals in the 60’s and 70’s, and how anthropological work can be informed by evolutionary psychology. This serves as a framework to understand the unique training processes that teach an individual that their mind is not only open to their own thoughts, but God’s as well. Luhrmann goes beyond a purely explanatory endeavor and is interested in understanding the processes that lead some to see God as “a person among people”. One aspect of this learning process, she found, involves pretense and instructs the individual to treat God as an imaginary friend, but with one caveat – God (to them) is real and imaginary friends are not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/group_prayer.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-6221 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/group_prayer-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"group_prayer\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\"></a></p>\n<p>Furthermore, while <em>imagining</em> God, Luhrmann uncovered that the individual is often instructed to treat God as they would another person, like a close friend you tell your secrets to. This helps to cultivate an understanding <em>and</em> experience of God that is highly <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/religion-as-anthropomorphism-an-interview-with-stewart-guthrie/\">anthropomorphic</a> and cognitively pleasing, rather than thinking of God as Aristotle’s “unmoved mover”, who would hardly be interested in your innermost thoughts. In closing, she details some of the prayer exercises that further help individuals to develop this personal sense of divine presence and answers an RSP listener&#8217;s question about the possibility of gender differences in experiencing the divine.</p>\n<p>You can visit Dr. Luhrmann’s website to find out more about her work and research at: <a href=\"http://luhrmann.net/\">http://luhrmann.net/</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;</span><a style=\"color: #2ba6cb;\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a><span style=\"color: #222222;\">.

    "content": "<p>Two firsts for the Religious Studies Project this week. Surprisingly, we&#8217;ve never talked about Shamanism, one of the watchwords of discourse on &#8220;indigenous religion&#8221; for scholars and laymen alike, insiders and outsiders. The term originates with the Romanian scholar Mircea Eliade, who took it from a specific group&nbsp;in the Tunguskee region of Russia, and applied it universally to describe individuals who communicate with spirits for the benefit of their communities. For Eliade, Shamanism was one more example of a <em>heirophany</em>, an interjection of an ineffable&nbsp;<em>sacred</em> into the mundane world. Unsurprisingly, however, when such <em>sui generis</em> notions are disregarded, and the category examined from the data up, the category ceases to be easily defined.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Redefining-Shamanisms-Spiritualist-Traditional-Apprenticeship/dp/1472579046/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416653847&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=redefining+shamanisms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61e2%2BTqHxsL.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"187\" height=\"282\"></a>In this interview, David Wilson tells us that while studying shamanism while undertaking training as a medium in the Spiritualist Church, he noticed that both seemed to exhibit similar features; an emphasis on healing, communication with the dead, as well as other &#8220;spiritual beings&#8221;, but most importantly, a pattern of training &nbsp;through apprenticeship. After telling us about his own experiences of training, he outlines how this pattern of apprenticeship &#8211; an initial &#8216;calling&#8217;, a process of direct training from established mediums, beginning public practise and finally acceptance by the broader community. Wilson&#8217;s &#8216;apprenticeship&#8217; model not only gives us a way to conceptualise shamanism without recourse to sui generis discourse, but draws interesting parallels between indigenous cultures and the somewhat&nbsp;hidden world of heterodox religious practices in the West, particularly in regards to the frequent presence of healthcare.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5326\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6267-22\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP122-wilson-Mastered-1.mp3?_=22\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP122-wilson-Mastered-1.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP122-wilson-Mastered-1.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP122-wilson-Mastered-1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6267-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP122-wilson-Mastered-1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP122-wilson-Mastered-1.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6267-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6267-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6267-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5327&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6267-23&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP122-wilson-Mastered-1.mp3?_=23&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP122-wilson-Mastered-1.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP122-wilson-Mastered-1.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>David&#8217;s book, <em>Redefining Shamanisms</em>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Redefining-Shamanisms-Spiritualist-Traditional-Apprenticeship/dp/1472579046/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416653847&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=redefining+shamanisms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is available in all formats now.&nbsp;</a>You can also download this podcast, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "title": "The Postsecular",
    "content": "<p>In his 2011 Presidential Address to the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion in Milwaukee, James Beckford focused upon a contested term that has grown in prominence in recent years in the social scientific study of religion – the notion of the ‘postsecular’. In this address – published in the JSSR in 2012, Beckford noted a number of problems associated with the concept.</p>\n<p>First, there is enormous variety in the meanings attributed to the ‘postsecular’, and there are many tensions between these meanings. Second, ‘the variety of meanings attributed to “postsecularity” is partly a function of the unusually wide range of intellectual disciplines and fields with an interest in it’. However, Beckford is keen to emphasise that this breadth of disciplinary interest does not imply that there actually is such a phenomenon as ‘postsecularity’. Third, ‘the orientation of many writings about the postsecular is normative and speculative’. (2012, 12-13)</p>\n<p>With these issues in mind, Chris took some time to speak solely on this contested topic with <a title=\"Kevin W. Gray\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/kevin-w-gray/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kevin W. Gray</a> while in Belfast for the <a href=\"http://belfast2014.esareligion.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ESA Sociology of Religion Research Network Conference</a> in September. Discussion focuses upon the history of the term, potential definitions, disciplinary and geographical differences, and ultimately suggests that ‘postsecularity’ is effectively dressing up ‘secularity’ in obfuscating clothing.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5328\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-6196-24\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP121-gray.mp3?_=24\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP121-gray.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP121-gray.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP121-gray.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=6196-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP121-gray.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP121-gray.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('6196-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_6196-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_6196-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5329&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-6196-25&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP121-gray.mp3?_=25&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP121-gray.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP121-gray.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this podcast, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "content": "\n<p>This week we are bringing you the fruits of a recent RSP venture to the University of Chester, UK. In the early afternoon, Chris and David ran a workshop on &#8220;Digital Humanities&#8221; for the postgraduate community in the Department of Theology and Religious Studies. Later on, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/religion-and-literature-an-interview-with-alana-vincent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">David interviewed Dr. Alana Vincent in from of a &#8216;live studio audience&#8217; on the topic of &#8216;Religion and Literature</a>&#8216;. Following directly on from this, Chris chaired a roundtable discussion on &#8216;Narrative and Reflexivity in the Study of Religion&#8217; featuring <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/wendy-dossett/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dr. Wendy Dossett</a>, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/elaine-graham/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Prof. Elaine Graham</a>, Dr. <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/dawn-llewellyn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dawn Llewellyn</a> and Dr. <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/alana-vincent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alana Vincent</a> — all staff in TRS at Chester — and the RSP&#8217;s own <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/ethan-gjerset-quillen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ethan Quillen</a>, of the University of Edinburgh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea for this roundtable was that it would follow on directly from the interview on religion and literature, but expand the discussion to cover a variety of points relating to narrative, autobiography and (auto)ethnography in the study of religion. This was also recorded in front of a live audience, and towards the end of the recording we take questions from the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the resources available at the University of Chester — specifically, a wonderful chap named Lee — we are able to bring you this roundtable discussion in video form — something a lot of our listeners have been keen on for quite some time. Let us know what you think! We can&#8217;t promise to do this very regularly, but if it is useful we will definitely investigate our options for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Narrative and Reflexivity in Religious Studies Roundtable Discussion\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f7XpeOO9OPc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussion addressed the following questions, and a lot more&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What do we mean when we speak of incorporating narratives into Religious Studies? Why would we want to?</li><li>What makes a narrative different from a discourse? Is there any difference?</li><li>Does studying narrative minimize other aspects of ‘religion’ such as ritual, embodiment, symbols etc? Is there anything particularly Western or gendered about privileging narratives?</li><li>Given that we focused upon&nbsp;‘religion and literature’, what is the place of fictional narratives? What can they tell us? Are all narratives fictions? Can one infer anything external to a narrative?</li><li>What is the place of the scholar in all of this? Are we interpreters? Are we co-creators of narratives? Do we remain outside the data we study or must we write ourselves in? What would this do to ‘objectivity’? Is the whole academic enterprise an exercise in creating narratives? Can academic reflexivity go to too far?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This podcast is presented to you as a co-production with the University of Chester, and we are very grateful for their help in making this happen — particularly to Dawn Llewellyn for organizing, and to Lee Bennett for the technical wizardry.</p>\n",

We can glean ethnographic or historical detail from literary works, and sometimes read particular insider discourses in their pages. We can read literature&nbsp;as a &#8220;sacred text&#8221; &#8211; or indeed, &#8220;sacred text&#8221; as literature&#8221;.

and &#8220;religion&#8221; has not only been central to western discourses on modernity, but has increasingly become a central supposition in the history of science itself – informing not just the rhetoric of the New Atheists, but also the broader public understanding of the issue.  But is this historically accurate?</p>\n<p>In this interview, Professor <a title=\"Peter Harrison\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/persons/peter-harrison/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peter Harrison</a> (formerly Idreos Professor of Science and Religion at Oxford) outlines the flaws in this supposition by providing a historical perspective on the categories &#8220;science&#8221; and &#8220;religion&#8221; and the way that they were formerly considered <em>separate</em> <em>virtues</em> (<em>scientia</em> and <em>religio</em>) instead of incompatible domains of knowledge.  Far from the current narrative being correct – often focusing on episodes such as the Church&#8217;s response to the Galileo controversy – Professor Harrison explains that religious institutions were originally (and for a long time) key supporters of scientific activity, which was considered broadly as a theological attempt to unlock The Book of Nature.   The middle section of the interview looks at the complex relationship between theological commitment and scientific activity from Newton to Darwin, and in the final section discusses continuing complexities of the relationship in the post-Darwinan western world, right down to problematic assumptions at play in contemporary New Atheism as well as debates about Islamic militancy.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5332\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-5919-28\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP118-Harrison-Mastered.mp3?_=28\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP118-Harrison-Mastered.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP118-Harrison-Mastered.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP118-Harrison-Mastered.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=5919-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RSP118-Harrison-Mastered.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP118-Harrison-Mastered.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('5919-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_5919-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_5919-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot;

In this broad-ranging interview, O’Mahony eruditely demonstrates what geography can bring to the academic study of ‘religion’ and presents Ireland as a fascinating context within which to examine processes of boundary-making between the contested constructs of ‘religion’ and the ‘secular’. After taking listeners through a sweeping history of ‘religion’ in Ireland, O’Mahony then discusses the contextual politics of studying ‘religion’ in Ireland before exploring three different contestations over ‘religious’ and ‘secular’ place-making in Ireland.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6086\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6086\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4735471594_999a4b7da8_b.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-6086 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4735471594_999a4b7da8_b-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bubble-wrapped statue of the Virgin Mary.

Second, discussion turns to place-making relations at sites of pilgrimage performance. And finally, Eoin focuses upon Catholic primary schools as political sites where children are ‘made’ both as ‘Catholics’ and as ‘citizens’. Through this detailed substantive and theoretical discussion, O’Mahony presents the local and particular as a challenge to dominant&nbsp; and simplistic sociological narratives of ‘<a title=\"Linda Woodhead on the Secularisation Thesis\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-linda-woodhead-on-the-secularisation-thesis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">secularization</a>’, problematizes simplistic divides between the ‘religious’ and the ‘secular’, ‘public’ and ‘private’, and contributes to a ‘decolonization’ of the ‘secular’ – and the study of ‘religion’ more broadly.

We managed to make time to get&nbsp;Bettina and David, along with panel participants Fiona Bowie and RSP editor Jonathan Tuckett, to sit down to record a session with David Robertson (<a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/religious-studies-and-the-paranormal-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, and part 2 <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/religious-studies-and-the-paranormal-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Bettina begins by outlining the aims and scope of the sessions, in which they hoped to bring together anthropologists, ethnographers&nbsp;and Religious Studies scholars with many different methodologies for looking at encounters with the non-ordinary. Fiona Bowie outlines her methodology for these kinds of studies, empathetic engagement, in which issues of ontological truth are set aside, but not &#8216;explained away&#8217;. She argues that such experiences may be at the root of &#8220;religious experience&#8221;, and are thus vital to the field. Davids Wilson and Robertson discuss whether the transformative nature of these experiences is epistemological at core. Remembering our critical approach, however, Jonathan challenges&nbsp;the emerging consensus that different methodologies require different epistemological postulates to be made sense of. It gets fairly heated.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5336\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-5967-32\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP116-Nonordinary-realities-roundtable.mp3?_=32\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP116-Nonordinary-realities-roundtable.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP116-Nonordinary-realities-roundtable.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP116-Nonordinary-realities-roundtable.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=5967-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP116-Nonordinary-realities-roundtable.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP116-Nonordinary-realities-roundtable.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('5967-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_5967-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_5967-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5337&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-5967-33&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP116-Nonordinary-realities-roundtable.mp3?_=33&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP116-Nonordinary-realities-roundtable.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP116-Nonordinary-realities-roundtable.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

Depending upon the measures, one possible outcome could be an ideal-typical podcast from your friends at <em>The Religious Studies Project. </em>Prepare in a slightly different manner and your culinary exploits could produce a manifestation of <a href=\"http://www.gladysganiel.com/social-justice/the-last-stop-understanding-the-emerging-church-movement-interview-with-gladys-ganiel-gerardo-marti-published-in-bearings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Emerging Church</a>. However, in the case of the latter, similar results might be obtained from a completely different set of ingredients.</p>\n<p>The Emerging Church Movement (ECM) is notoriously difficult to define. What are scholars of ‘religion’ to do with a trend seemingly emerging both within and without many contemporary manifestations of (Western) Christianity, that is both anti-institutional and ecumenical, aims to avoid hierarchies and power structures, embraces creativity, deconstruction and experimentation, and actively promotes a ‘neutral’ and ‘non-judgmental religious space’ where almost anything goes? In this week’s podcast, Chris is joined by Dr Gladys Ganiel to discuss this ‘problematic’, important and boundary-pushing phenomenon.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5340\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-5486-36\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP114-Ganiel.mp3?_=36\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP114-Ganiel.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP114-Ganiel.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP114-Ganiel.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=5486-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP114-Ganiel.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP114-Ganiel.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('5486-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_5486-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_5486-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5341&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-5486-37&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP114-Ganiel.mp3?_=37&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP114-Ganiel.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSP114-Ganiel.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0199959889/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0199959889&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Deconstructed Church: Understanding Emerging Christianity </em></a>(Oxford, 2014), Ganiel and co-author Gerardo Marti write:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We define Emerging Christians in terms of sharing a <em>religious orientation </em>built on a continual practice of deconstruction. We characterize the ECM as an <em>institutionalizing structure</em>, made up of a package of beliefs, practices, and identities that are continually deconstructed and reframed by the <em>religious institutional entrepreneurs</em> who drive the movement and seek to resist its institutionalization. As such, the ECM is best seen as a mix of both reactive and proactive elements, vying for the passion and attention of Christians and nonbelievers. Emerging Christians <em>react </em>primarily against conservative/evangelical/fundamentalist Protestantism but also against other forms of traditional Christianity that they have experienced as inauthentic. At the same time, they <em>proactively </em>appropriate practices from a range of Christian traditions [&#8230;] to nourish their individual spirituality and to enhance their life together as communities.” (25-26)</p></blockquote>\n<p>What is it that makes this movement ‘Christian’? What does it do to traditional understandings of ‘religion’ and ‘secularization’? How does one research such a seemingly diffuse and unbounded phenomenon? Is it only a matter of time before this movement undergoes a process of systematization?

Coleman III, Dr. Johnson begins by discussing the preparation leading up to his ethnography of the Pentecostal prison ministries in Rio de Janero Brazil. He takes the listener through the streets and slums of Rio, and into a prison cell-block. Here, we learn about the gang life that largely runs the prison, and the “gang like” life (Pentecostal prison ministries) that&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;provide a temporary escape from the physically and psychologically damaging conditions of the jail, and&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;just provide eternal redemption through the faith of the pious prisoner. Johnson discusses the role of politics in the prison system, why Pentecostalism dominates the jails in a predominately catholic country such as Brazil, and “answers” the question of how to tell if someone is&nbsp;<em>truly faithful</em>. He discusses how prisoners are viewed by their community after their release, and upon conversion as an allegedly devout pentecostal. In closing, Dr. Johnson speculates about the future of pentecostal prison ministries in Brazil, and argues for “the religious lives of inmates being taken seriously apart from recidivism rates”.</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out Dr. Johnson’s plenary address, the world debut of his documentary <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/34398578\"><em>If I Give My Soul</em></a>, at the 2014 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion conference in Indianapolis Indiana October 31<sup>st</sup> – November 2<sup>nd</sup>.

Links with cognitive approaches? Is ‘memory’ different from ‘tradition’? ‘Memorialisation’? ‘Myth’? ‘Legend’? ‘Story’? What makes religion distinctive in this sense? Are we not just studying memories? In what sense is basically every element of research an act of research into memory? An act of memorialisation? Must all ‘memory’ and ‘experience’ be articulated in order to be studied? These questions and more form the framework for this interview, which demonstrates the utility of thinking about ‘religion’ theoretically and methodologically through the interpretive lens of memory.</p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

Meyer’s keynote address, ‘Visual Culture and the Study of Religion,’ sought to make an intervention into the study of religion and material and visual culture through an understanding of religion as a practice of <em>mediation</em>, one in and through which some kind of spiritual or divine presence, however conceptualised, is effected, actualised, or materialised. Meyer argued that such an understanding of religion as mediation allows us to draw attention to the fascinating issue of religious images and sensory regimes, thinking through the implications of placing such visual culture and a consideration of material, multi-sensuous embodiment at the core of scholarly inquiry for the production of knowledge about religion.</p>\n<p>After the keynote, <a href=\"http://sydney.academia.edu/GeorgeIoannides\">George Ioannides</a> had the opportunity to meet with Professor Meyer to discuss her work, her career, her views on the importance of studying religion and/as material and visual culture, and her advice for students who similarly wish to research topics at the intersection of cultural anthropology and the study of religion.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5348\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-5653-44\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RSP110-Meyer.mp3?_=44\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RSP110-Meyer.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RSP110-Meyer.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RSP110-Meyer.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=5653-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RSP110-Meyer.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP110-Meyer.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('5653-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_5653-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_5653-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5349&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-5653-45&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RSP110-Meyer.mp3?_=45&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RSP110-Meyer.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RSP110-Meyer.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on </span><a style=\"color: #2ba6cb;\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a><span style=\"color: #222222;\">.

We were hosted by a University on the brink of celebrating its 4ooth year and which looked forward to infinity and beyond! To a city whose name, the President of the University no less assured us is pronounced with a guttural g-, a rolled –r and a silent –g to finish! Not too difficult for a Scotsman but there was plenty of beer, wine and gin to aid in this process</p>\n<p>The conference theme this year was ‘religion and the plurality of knowledge’, a topic which I initially considered dubious but which proved to be deeply pertinent. It became clear to me at least, during the many presentations and discussions taking place, that there was a division between those who regarded the kind of knowledge which should be accepted within the field to be singular – rooted in science and empiricism and those who thought the field should be open to a range of types of knowledge.</p>\n<p>To address this issue there was only solution for the RSP: hold a roundtable of course! So, in a small room a group of bright young things gathered around ‘Steve’ the dictaphone to have a discussion. Also I was there! They even let me chair it and put up with my no doubt flawed attempt to kick off proceedings in Dutch!

The conversation then moves&nbsp;into the early modern period and the changes wrought by the Reformation, the rise of the political state, and the&nbsp;subsequent period&nbsp;of religious conflict. &nbsp;&nbsp;At this point we begin to see something that looks like the modern English category &#8220;religion&#8221;, although that&nbsp;shift&nbsp;was not fully consolidated until the formalization of philology and ancient world studies in the nineteenth century.</p>\n<p>This podcast will interest all students of religion, regardless of their area of&nbsp;speciality.

Ladd begins the interview by discussing what it <em>means</em> to pray. Perhaps most important, he explains how prayer is defined for research purposes, emphasizing that there is no essential definition, nor is one desirable. In taking care to uphold a scientific understanding of prayer, rather than a theologically apologetic one, Ladd understands prayer as a “psychological phenomena”, but with a “theological sensitivity to it”. In other words, we can understand prayer from a scientific point of view while also recognizing its (typically) theological basis. Ladd covers ‘types of prayer’ noting that there is more than one way to categorize differences in prayer. However, is there a secular source or equivalent for prayer? Are there differences between males and females? Does an individual’s age make a difference? Furthermore, if you want to know what a small army of undergraduate researchers, digital cameras, ‘casually dressed’ mannequins, and a labyrinth have to do with prayer research be sure to listen to the interview.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5369\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5369\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/station-1-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-5369\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/station-1-5-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"A 'labyrinth' \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5369\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A &#8216;labyrinth&#8217;</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on&nbsp;</span><a style=\"color: #2ba6cb;\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a><span style=\"color: #222222;\">.

The Anastenaria are Orthodox Christians in Northern Greece who celebrate the Saints Constantine and Helen in a two part ritual cycle each year. They have no written texts, as the tradition and myths encompassing the firewalkers are passed down orally through story telling and by participation in ritual. Their tradition is, as Xygalatas writes (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1845539761/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1845539761&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\">2012</a>, p. 2) “a good example of a physically and emotionally arousing ritual, and such rituals raise a very important question regarding their participants’ motivation: why do people engage in extreme, costly ritual activities, that offer no obvious advantage but entail evident risks?” Widely known and respected for bringing experimental methods into the tough and fast paced conditions entailed by fieldwork on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmug97eZwFo\">extreme rituals</a>, Xygalatas combines rich description with scientific explanation to present a portrait of the Anastenaria that holds firm to the ‘anthropological attitude’ of understanding, while also providing an explanation for <em>why</em> people may behave the way they do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/anastenaria1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5237\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/anastenaria1-300x285.jpg\" alt=\"anastenaria1\" width=\"300\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/anastenaria1-300x285.jpg 300w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/anastenaria1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The interview begins with a discussion of the cultural context of the Anastenaria in Greece, noting widespread discrimination against their religious practices by the government and Greek Orthodox Church. He explains some of the shared beliefs the Anastenaria hold and describes the ritual cycle for the festival of St. Constantine and St. Helen. But, why would anyone be compelled to walk across burning coals? Xygalatas goes on to highlight the underlying cognitive and physiological mechanisms that may contribute to participation in extreme rituals, discusses the transmission of beliefs and revelation in the Anastenaria and highlights the importance and meaning of the rituals. In closing, <a href=\"http://www.xygalatas.com/\">Dr. Xygalatas</a> shares a very personal moment from additional fieldwork in Spain that turned himself, the researcher, into the subject being researched.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Burning-Saints-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"untitled\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">.

As Gilhus then suggests, our theoretical positions are impoverished if they don&#8217;t address &#8220;religion&#8221; in both classical and modern contexts.</p>\n<p>Marion Bowman takes this up in her response, which addresses the similarity between this project and her own &#8220;vernacular religion&#8221; project. Bettina Schmidt addresses this disconnect between theories of&nbsp;popular and institutionalised religion from a anthropological point of view, pointing out that many phenomena have been removed from sociological view due to their perceived marginality, and because they don&#8217;t offer a clear box to be ticked in censuses. Finally, David Robertson critiques how the critique of &#8220;New Age&#8221; is positioned within academic, practitioner and popular discourses, and how it may reinforce, despite itself, the very categories it seeks to dissolve.</p>\n<p>For anyone interested in New Age, the intersection between category formation &#8211; and the practicalities and politics of challenging them &#8211; this episode will be essential listening.</p>\n",

In this interview with David Robertson (our 100th &#8220;official&#8221; podcast!), Ingvild Gilhus, a historian of religion with considerable experience in dealing with popular religion in both the ancient and modern worlds, discusses where the concept of angels comes from and how they have been variously constructed, from the white-suited messengers of the New Testament to the embodiment of the &#8220;higher self&#8221; in New Age accounts.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5368\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-5092-64\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RSP100-gilhus.mp3?_=64\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RSP100-gilhus.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RSP100-gilhus.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RSP100-gilhus.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=5092-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RSP100-gilhus.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP100-gilhus.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('5092-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_5092-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_5092-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5369&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-5092-65&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RSP100-gilhus.mp3?_=65&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RSP100-gilhus.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RSP100-gilhus.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>In particular, she explains that angels seem always to break boundaries.

McCloud argues that rising supernatural interest coincides with consumerism and neoliberal capitalism. In the spiritual warfare manuals that serve as his primary data, capitalist and even therapeutic language seems to mark this as a product that borrows from a wide range of 20th century themes. Even perceived enemies of evangelicalism—like the soft metaphysical stylings of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1847370292/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1847370292&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\"><em>The Secret</em></a>—become fodder for incorporation into the spiritual warfare paradigm.

Moreover, Frankl proposed that meaning could be found in even the most malignant and desolate of places – even in “the midst of Nazi death camp hell” (p.51). According to this view humans are not only creatures of meaning, but <i>willed to</i> find<i> </i>meaning.</p>\n<p>Recently, scholars have placed the concept of ‘meaning making’ as an important area of focus within psychology of religion (Paloutzian &amp; Park, 2005; 2013). Some people find meaning in religious or spiritual experience and beliefs while others find meaning on more secular mediums in life. One way comparisons among religious or secular individuals and worldviews can be made is at the level of ultimate meanings. However, if humans are truly on a “search for meaning”, as Frankl has argued, what might be some of the sources of such meaning?</p>\n<p>In her interview with Thomas Coleman recorded at the 2013 International Association for the Psychology of Religion World Conference, <a href=\"http://www.sinnforschung.org/\">Dr. Tatjana Schnell</a> discusses on-going research conceptualizing and measuring sources of meaning and meaning in life. Her work has been examined internationally with promise of cross-cultural application (Silver, Bernaud, Pedersen, Birkeland, la Cour &amp; Schnell, 2013). What makes her work particularly interesting is that meaning making is not dependent on any particular modal identity or value system but rather the profound experience one has in their life.</p>\n<p>Schnell begins the interview by explaining the methodology behind the construction of her <i>Sources of Meaning and Meaning in Life Questionnaire</i><i> </i>(<a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760903271074\">SoMe</a>). She goes on to emphasize the role that meaning plays in not only religious individuals but also the growing secular population around the world. Dr. Schnell discusses ultimate sources of meaning, making space for both secular and religious experiences of transcendence termed horizontal and vertical transcendence. Throughout the podcast Dr. Tatjana Schnell’s message is clear, ultimate sources of meaning in life come from many areas and are meaningful to different people and for different reasons. Some find meaning in religion, others find meaning in more secular ways. Regardless of the label used, meaning is central to the human condition. Towards the end of the interview Schnell builds on an old quote by John Stuart Mill. Schnell asks is it better “to be a satisfied cow, or an unsatisfied Socrates”?</p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

The Humanities and Technology Camp is an open meeting for those desiring a conference experience outside of the presentation of formal papers. Participants submitted ideas ahead of time to the <a href=\"http://aar2013.thatcamp.org/\">AAR THATCamp website</a>, but the final shape and content of the event was decided on-site by a vote. In the busy weekend of paper sessions, THATCamp AAR was an oasis of facilitate first, pontificate second. As digital religious studies emerges within the broader digital humanities movement, the Camp was a rather bold move for the AAR, whose interaction has been driven by more conservative timelines.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">THATCamp represents one of the bright spots of the digital world and its potential for conference goers. It emphasizes hands-on experience, privileges active learning, and puts expertise and enthusiasm for technology side-by-side. It can be chaotic with its impromptu schedule, but the advantage is the flexibility it offers to solve problems, foster dialogue, and teach digital skills.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">Over the course of the day participants had the option to become more familiar with the online curation platform </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"https://omeka.org/\">Omeka</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">, learn about the many options for digital publishing, brainstorm ways to harness outside technological expertise for humanities projects, discuss the role of media in the classroom, learn the basics of big data, and even get tips about doing digital ethnography with students. The schedule is still up </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"http://aar2013.thatcamp.org/schedule/\">here</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">, but it was as full a day of information as even the most seasoned technophiles could handle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">For the conference organizers that sat together for a few brief minutes over lunch, there was awareness of both the promises and perils of the digital world. As a fledgling research method whose products are varied and often unique, there is a great need for clear standards of evaluation of “good scholarship in the digital realm.” This should be of special concern to early career scholars who may have to fight for the presence of digital work in their tenure portfolios or in grant applications. This problem would be addressed not only by the development and promotion of open platforms for scholarly work, but also by sincere discussion about basic digital literacy and professionalization with digital tools and methods. Publishers, professional organizations, libraries, departments, scholars, and students&#8211;everyone in the academic chain will need to work out their roles for digital methods and digital work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">With so little time, several questions were pre-circulated to help things move along quickly on these topics.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">What does it mean to teach or research religious studies digitally?</p>\n<p>Does religious &#8220;data&#8221; make digital religious studies distinct within the digital humanities?</p>\n<p>What is a digital religious studies research project you think more people should know about?</p>\n<p>How can departments and the field better support digital methods and pedagogies?</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">For each of the six participants, digital methods and platforms are a key element in their identity as scholars.

In this day and age, one might be inclined to ask if these three words, when combined, can contribute anything resembling a &#8216;positive health outcome&#8217;. However, Much of the current literature on psychology of religion and its relationship to coping may indicate that belief can contribute positively in the process of coping and meaning making for religious individuals (Park, 2013).</p>\n<p>In The Future of an Illusion (1927/1961), Freud viewed religion as “comparable to a childhood neurosis” (p. 53). However, he also noted it as “the most precious possession of civilization” and “the most precious thing it has to offer its participants” (p. 20). While Freud was certainly critical of ‘religion’, he nevertheless understood what Williams James (1975) called its “cash value”. That is, regardless of the truthiness or falsity of religion as an ontological fact, religion can have value for those who practice and believe. According to <a href=\"http://www.spiritualityandhealth.duke.edu/index.php/harold-g-koenig-m-d\">Dr. Harold Koenig</a>, a leading psychiatrist in the field of religion, spirituality and health, and the Director of the Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health at Duke University Medical Center, one way that religion and spirituality may explicate its cash value is in the realm of physical and mental health.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Spirituality_Health_Research-220x300.jpg\" alt=\"Spirituality_Health_Research\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" /></a>In his interview with Thomas Coleman conducted at the 2013 <a href=\"http://www.spiritualityandhealth.duke.edu/index.php/5-day-summer-research-course\">Duke University Summer Research Course on Religion, Spirituality and Health</a>, Dr. Koenig broadly discusses the field of religion, spirituality (R/S) and health. He notes that all things being equal people who measure higher on R/S variables typically have improved mental and physical health – carefully relaying that all things being equal is a key component to the relationship. Koenig states that it is not mere identification as R/S that influences health, but sincerity and commitment of belief and action that matters.  He mentions the need for ‘secular sources’ in the R/S and health field in order to draw comparisons between the relationship of R/S variables with other variables that may function in a similar manner. In discussing how he operationalizes the variables of ‘religion’ and ‘spirituality’ for research purposes, Koenig emphasizes that importance of definitions of R/S are always in reference to the Transcendent (i.e. defined substantively). In closing,  it is clear that the relationship between religion, spirituality and health is complex and multifaceted. If you are interested in learning more about R/S and health research Dr. Koenig invites you check out the Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health website at: <a href=\"http://www.spiritualityandhealth.duke.edu/\">http://www.spiritualityandhealth.duke.edu/</a>. Religion may not be a cure for the common cold, but it seemingly can provide one possible source of wellbeing for its adherents in the world today.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">.

In that first ‘test’ for the ones that would follow, six of us gathered together to discuss the ‘<a title=\"Roundtable: What is the Future of Religious Studies?\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/roundtable-what-is-the-future-of-religious-studies/\">future of religious studies</a>.’</p>\n<p>A few highlights from that recording are the revelation that what one does with a degree in religious studies inevitably leads toward a fine career at Starbucks, that ‘relativity,’ being one step from ‘subjectivity,’ is the ‘post-modernist quagmire of death and destruction that will consume all academic fields if it’s allowed to spread too far,’ and that we ourselves, despite the wishes of many, are not, in fact, the future of religious studies.</p>\n<p>After that first attempt came many others and the RSP has blossomed nicely. A few of us finished the degrees that were at that time ‘in-progress’ and moved on—and away—from Edinburgh. This last September we were given the opportunity—thanks to romance—to all be back in town, and arranged a ‘reunion-of-sorts.’ This time, our conversation was a bit less organized, but by no means less interesting. A few of us had begun working on Ph.D. programs, and a few of us had just entered into the early-to-final stages of those begun around the time of the first recording. We sat in the same seats, in the same room, and sipped the same canned cocktails as before. Interestingly, our positions, opinions, and arguments seem both old and new, the result of time working together, learning each other’s personalities, and becoming closer friends and colleagues. Please share in our discussion, comment, discuss on your own and, as always, thanks for listening.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4982\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4982\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_20130914_003841.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4982\" alt=\"Kevin came back to Edinburgh, cap in hand.

    "content": "\n<p>There&#8217;s a group on Facebook devoted to the History of Religions. Apart from a quite regularly posted Christian bible study blog that&#8217;s devoted to scriptural exegesis—and which prompts reader comments such as this recent one:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It seems obvious God is a God who feels. I am imagining He grieved, felt sorry not only to see the depravity of man whom He made in His image, but of every single cell which He created, His art, His masterpiece. God as an artist experiencing the destruction and loss of it all. Every flower, creature, piece of nature which He had created GOOD.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>—almost all that gets posted on its wall are links to articles or announcements about the things we study: decaying scrolls found here or there, rituals practiced by this or that group, etc. Once in a while you see a link to an article on methodology—how we study things—but rarely does someone post an item related to why we study them or why our work should matter to people who don’t happen to share our focus on this piece of pottery or that ancient text. That’s because it seems that, for many if not most of us, there’s an obviousness to the things that we’re interested in, both for us, as scholars, as well as for the wider groups in which we live and shop and work: we all know they’re important because, well…, they’re important, simple as that.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10000128_10102136414819645_635038881_n.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"507\" height=\"208\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10000128_10102136414819645_635038881_n.jpg\" alt=\"10000128_10102136414819645_635038881_n\" class=\"wp-image-4953\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10000128_10102136414819645_635038881_n.jpg 507w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10000128_10102136414819645_635038881_n-300x123.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s therefore intriguing about <a href=\"https://religion.ua.edu/people/steven-ramey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Steven Ramey</a>’s work is that while he, like all of us, was trained in a specific expertise related to a world religion, to fieldwork, to languages, and to texts and distant lands—he did his Ph.D. at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in the religions of south Asia, and came to the University of Alabama in 2006, after a couple years working at UNC Pembroke—over the course of his career he has gradually and smoothly made a significant shift. Of course he still studies material relevant to his earlier training, but a shift in research focus from inter-religious cooperation to diaspora religion, eventually studying south Asian communities in the U.S. south, led the way to a far broader interest not only in social theory but in the practical implications of categorization for creating identities. Now, apart from regularly blogging on wide topics in identity formation at <a href=\"http://edge.ua.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Culture on the Edge</a> (a research group in which he participates), he is among the few who paused when some Pew survey data came out not long ago, on the so-called “Nones” (people who responded to a questionnaire saying that they had no religious affiliation), and asked how reasonably it is for scholars to assume that an entire, cohesive social group somehow exists based on a common answer to this or that isolated question when the respondents differed so much on the rest of the survey? The point? Why do we, as scholars, think the Nones are out there and what effect does our presumption of their identity have on making it possible for others to think and act as if the Nones are real and of growing influence?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was this career arc—moving from what or how we study to why we study something, focusing on the wider theoretical interests that motivate our work with specific e.g.s and which out to be relevant to scholars in fields far outside the academic study of religion—that prompted Russell McCutcheon to sit down with Steven, his colleague at Alabama, on a chilly day last December, to talk about Steven&#8217;s training and earlier interests butt then to learn more about how a scholar who heads up our <a href=\"https://asianstudies.as.ua.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interdisciplinary minor in Asian Studies</a> found himself at the Baltimore meeting of the American Academy of Religion <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/album/2643896\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">inviting Americanists and sociologists to give the Nones a second thought</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Thanks to Russell McCutcheon for writing this piece, and for conducting the interview.

He is well known for his theory of communicative action, which claims that reason, or rationality, is the mechanism for emancipation from the social problems posed by modernity. In his earlier work, Habermas mostly ignored religion, contending that it was not rational enough to be included in public debate. But over the past decade, he has begun to reexamine religion in light of its persistence in the modern world, calling this a turn toward post-secular society. He argues that religion deserves a place in public debate, but that religious people need to translate their views into rational, secular language if they want to participate in the public sphere. </span>This week&#8217;s podcast features Dusty Hoesly of the University of California at Santa Barbara speaking with Michelle Dillon, Professor of Sociology at the University of New Hampshire, at the 2013 SSSR Conference in Boston.</p>\n<p>While Dillon embraces Habermas&#8217; turn toward religion and his recognition of its emancipatory potential, she critiques his post-secular theorizing, arguing that Habermas ignores the rational contestation of ideas within religions; marginalizes the centrality of emotion, tradition, and spirituality to religion; and fails to recognize religion&#8217;s intertwining with the secular.</p>\n<p><a style=\"font-size: 1rem; color: #0f3647;\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0521000785/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0521000785&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0521000785&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" alt=\"\" width=\"113\" height=\"160\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

That is to say, and from this point of view, that religion was not merely a result of the transformation from a hunter-gather lifestyle to a more sedentary, agricultural, domicile based life – it was the very catalyst. Or, as Norenzayan puts it, “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0691151210/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0691151210&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">religion transformed cooperation and conflict</a>”.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/web-stone-age-engher.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/web-stone-age-engher-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"hunter-gatherers \" class=\"wp-image-4818\" width=\"257\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/web-stone-age-engher-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/web-stone-age-engher.jpg 620w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px\" /></a><figcaption>Hunter-gatherers</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Archaeological sites such as <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gobekli-tepe-the-worlds-first-temple-83613665/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gobekli Tepe</a> in southeastern Turkey, predating Stonehenge by 6,000 years, tell scientists a lot about the priorities of humans with the retreat of the last Ice Age – the Gods demanded worship. This claim, which puts ‘religion’ first in the development of ‘society’, is the result of interpretations of data such as Gobekli Tepe that suggest that Homo sapiens were interested in building places of worship before they were interested in building permanent homes and domesticating livestock (see <a href=\"http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_2000_num_26_1_4697\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Schmidt, 2000</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scottish Philosopher David Hume espoused a view that situated religion not in the realm of the supernatural, but in the natural, arising from the inclinations and dispositions of the human <i>mind</i>. Sociologist Emile Durkheim conceptualized religion&#8217;s primary function as a <em>social glue</em> that binds individuals together through the establishment of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;t&#8217;s which acted as credible and authoritative sources which enabled the flourishing and maintenance of society. In his book <em>Big Gods</em>, Norenzayan combines both of these prior views with evidential support from various scientific disciplines.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-medium wp-image-4815 is-style-rounded\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gobekli-full_35417_600x450-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Cooperation at Gobekli Tepe circa. 10,000 BCE?\" class=\"wp-image-4815\" width=\"269\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gobekli-full_35417_600x450-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gobekli-full_35417_600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px\" /><figcaption>Cooperation at Gobekli Tepe circa. 10,000 BCE?</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas Coleman’s interview with Dr. Ara Norenzayan begins by posing an interesting question. How do we explain the transition from small, tight-knit communities (the norm from a historical perspective) to the large-scale societies we know today? In answering this question Norenzayan puts the idea of Big Gods front and center, Big Gods being those that are omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent and act as moralizing agents. Norenzayan then covers what he labels as “The Eight Principles of Big Gods” (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0691151210/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0691151210&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Norenzayan, 2013</a>), and closes by presenting an interesting analogy, placing many of the modern secular institutions we have today (e.g. police departments and governments) in the role previously occupied solely by religion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>References:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Norenzayan, A. 2013. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0691151210/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0691151210&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><i>Big gods</i></a>.

But despite the wide range of developments across archaeology and the physical sciences, evolutionary treatments of religion have remained few and far between, with most prominent ones coming from the hyper-partisan scholars of the New Atheist movement. But that situation has begun to change. Although works such as Roy Rappaport’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000VDKF7E/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B000VDKF7E&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\"><i>Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity </i></a>(1999) began to lay the ground for a more nuanced treatment, the publication of Robert Bellah’s groundbreaking new work, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0674061438/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0674061438&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\"><i>Religion in Human Evolution: From the Paleolithic to the Axial Age</i></a> (2011), signals a new era in the study of long-term religious and cultural history in which scientific, social-scientific and historical approaches can be properly brought into conversation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Donald_memory.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4664 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Donald_memory-300x234.png\" alt=\"Donald_memory\" width=\"300\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Donald_memory-300x234.png 300w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Donald_memory.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>One of the key figures behind Bellah’s work is evolutionary psychologist Merlin Donald, who spoke with Jack Tsonis at the 2013 AAR meeting in Baltimore about his paper “Ritual, Religion, and the Drama of Daily Life: The continued dominance of mimetic representation”.  In addition to an overview of Donald’s work and a discussion about ritual in the basic sense of “culturally patterned sequences of expression”, Jack also asks Professor Donald about the way that Bellah has used his ideas, which reveals a subtle but important difference in emphasis.

Introduction aside: ‘<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXZbWPXKsNE\">religion is natural and science is not</a>’, at least according to philosopher and cognitive scientist of religion Dr. Robert N. McCauley.</p>\n<p>In this view, ‘popular religion’ (i.e. <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/religion-as-anthropomorphism-an-interview-with-stewart-guthrie/\">attributing agency</a> to inanimate objects, belief in spirits, belief in the supernatural &#8211; not to be confused with creating ‘theologies’ or ‘catechisms’) typically arises <i>naturally</i> from human cognitive faculties. ‘Naturally’, meaning at an early age in the course of normal human development, requiring little-to-no encouragement or support from the environment, and with likely origins stretching far back into our evolutionary history. However, science often proceeds rather counter-intuitively (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Against-Method-Paul-Feyerabend/dp/1844674428\">Feyerabend, 1993</a>) and requires <i>practice</i> (i.e. learning and repetition), as well as institutions to support its proliferation and credibility (e.g. universities and agencies such as the National Science Foundation). Your average 8 year old might hold a belief in what McCauley and Lawson term as a “culturally postulated superhuman agent” (2002) such as a god, Jinn or the Tooth Fairy, but they are unlikely to be donning a white lab coat and analyzing the output from a<i> f</i><em>unctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) machine.</em></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4734\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4734\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1909054_10201570828129407_535995259_o.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4734\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1909054_10201570828129407_535995259_o-300x198.jpg\" alt=\"RSP Editors in Chief Christopher Cotter and David Robertson provide a colorful illustration of the 'religion is natural, science is not' thesis.\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1909054_10201570828129407_535995259_o-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1909054_10201570828129407_535995259_o-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1909054_10201570828129407_535995259_o.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4734\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">RSP Editors in Chief Christopher Cotter and David Robertson provide a colorful illustration of the &#8216;religion is natural, science is not&#8217; thesis.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>In Robert McCauley’s interview with Thomas Coleman for the RSP on why<i> Religion is Natural and Science is Not</i>, McCauley begins by presenting a “new twist” in the ongoing dialogue between science and religion by exploring, and comparing, each concept from a cognitive standpoint taking into account the thought processes required to support both religion and science. He gives a brief outline of a <a href=\"http://www.ualberta.ca/~francisp/Phil488/EvansDualProcessing2008.pdf\">dual process model</a> of cognition (e.g. thinking fast vs. thinking slow) drawing an important distinction between two forms of ‘fast thinking’, labeled as “practiced naturalness” and “maturational naturalness”. The former arises only after some type of cultural instruction, arriving late in our evolutionary past and may require a special artifact (e.g. being taught to ride a bike requires a bike!), while the latter arises ‘easily’ in the course of human development, is evolutionarily old and the only special artifact required is the <i>mind</i> (e.g. by age 3 the majority of children in the world are walking).</p>\n<p>In exploring precisely ‘what’s in a name’ McCauley clarifies how he uses the terms “religion” and “science” stating that maturationally natural processes are required for religion, whereas, practiced naturalness is required for science. In closing, he addresses an important question. If ‘religious cognition’ is natural, what does this mean for people who lack a belief in God? McCauley offers up one possible avenue of explanation, putting forth the idea that variations may occur in an individual’s <a href=\"http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/goldman/Theory%20of%20Mind%20_Oxford%20Handbook_.pdf.pdf\">Theory Of Mind</a>, or, the degree to which one can perceive the mental states of other conspecifics, thus affecting that person’s ability to mentally represent a super natural agent by giving it ontological veridicality.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5384\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-4696-80\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP91-McCauley.mp3?_=80\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP91-McCauley.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP91-McCauley.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP91-McCauley.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=4696-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP91-McCauley.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP91-McCauley.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('4696-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_4696-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_4696-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5385&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-4696-81&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP91-McCauley.mp3?_=81&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP91-McCauley.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP91-McCauley.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "content": "<p>As of the late 1950’s, radical ‘Behaviorism’ was beginning to decline in lieu of cognitive-behavioral approaches. The mind was no longer a ‘black box’ that prevented us from looking inside, nor was it a ‘blank slate’ shaped solely by ones environment. Largely inspired by Noam Chomsky’s concept of a ‘universal grammar’, and a foundation laid by Alan Turing that conceived of the brain as analogous to a computer, anthropology slowly shifted from an interpretive hermeneutic endeavor, to one aimed at identifying culturally reoccurring patterns of behavior and thought (i.e. universals), and providing an explanation for these universals. This explanation was rooted not in culture itself, but within the <i>mind.</i></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4627\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4627\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_4825.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4627\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_4825-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"This piece of drift wood is looking at you!\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_4825-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_4825-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4627\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This piece of drift wood is looking at you!</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>It was only a matter of time before a cognitive approach was applied to religion. While cognitive anthropologists such as Dan Sperber (<a href=\"http://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/Rethinking-Symbolism.pdf\">1975</a>) set the tone for such an approach, Dr. Stewart Guthrie was the first to offer up a “comprehensive cognitive theory of religion” (Xygalatas, 2012). In 1980 Guthrie published his seminal paper titled <a href=\"http://genealogyreligion.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Cognitive-Theory-Religion.pdf\"><i>A Cognitive Theory of Religion</i></a>. In 1993 he greatly expanded upon his earlier work and published the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Faces-Clouds-New-Theory-Religion/dp/0195098919\"><i>Faces In The Clouds: A New Theory Of Religion</i></a> further supporting “religion as anthropomorphism” (p. 177). Standing on the shoulders of giants, Guthrie’s “new theory of religion” peeked above the clouds ushering in a shift from purely descriptive levels of analysis applied to religion, to ones that also provided explanations for religion.</p>\n<p>In Stewart Guthrie’s interview with Thomas J. Coleman III, Guthrie begins by outlining what it means to ‘explain religion’. He defines anthropomorphism as “the attribution of human characteristics to nonhuman events” and gives an example of this as applied to auditory and visual phenomena throughout the interview. After discussing some current support for his theory, he presents the purview of scholarship on anthropomorphism stretching back to 500 BCE. Guthrie argues for anthropomorphism as ‘the core of religious experience’ synthesizing prior thought from Spinoza and Hume and applying an evolutionary perspective situated on the concept of ‘game theory’.

    "content": "<p>For those of us in Britain the question of Religious Education has become an ever-increasing issue of concern. Just last October Ofsted, the regulatory board for all education at school level, reported that over half the schools in Britain were failing to provide students with adequate RE. In the wake of this calls were made for clearer standardisation of the subject and a &#8220;national benchmark&#8221;. The deterioration of RE is perhaps not all that surprising after it was excluded from the English Baccalaureate in 2011. But the call for improvement raises with it a number of questions. First and foremost, just what exactly should RE entail? Should RE be teaching about religion or teaching religion? Who, even, should be RE teachers? PGCE (teacher training) courses in RE accept candidates with degrees in Religious Studies, Theology, Philosophy or indeed any other topic so long as they can, in the words of one program, show &#8220;demonstrable knowledge of the study of religion&#8221;. But does a theologian or a philosopher have the same skill sets as an RS scholar? To be sure, they may know the facts of a particular religion but are the facts enough for a satisfactory education? Just what is exactly is it we are teaching students to do in RE classrooms?</p>\n<p>In this interview, Jonathan Tuckett speaks with Tim Jensen to try to answer some of these questions and more. Not only has Jensen spoken widely on the topic of RE he has recently headed the EASR working group in Religious Education which has studied the status of RE in Denmark, Sweden and Norway highlighting that the question of RE is of particular concern to any secular state.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5388\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-4595-84\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP89-jensen.mp3?_=84\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP89-jensen.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP89-jensen.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP89-jensen.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=4595-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP89-jensen.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP89-jensen.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('4595-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_4595-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_4595-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5389&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-4595-85&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP89-jensen.mp3?_=85&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP89-jensen.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RSP89-jensen.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

Detractors often respond to ontological positions such as atheism and agnosticism with expostulation, and even impertinence. This said, there is plenty of evidence to support that secular movements can provide socially responsible and ethical structures, and the Council for Secular Humanism is one such organization which encourages dialogue and ethical responsibility beyond the boundaries of traditional religious ideologies.</p>\n<p class=\"size-medium wp-image-4532 \">Throughout history the dominating attitude towards Freethinkers and nonbelievers in a God or gods might be summed up best in Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s <i>The Brothers Karamazov </i>when he famously wrote, “If there is no God, everything is permitted”. In other words, and turning this into a question worthy of inquiry, what can help structure the lives of the many people who are often labeled as having ‘no structure’ without God? Certainly, distrust of atheists has historical roots and even persists today (Norenzayan, 2013). While debates about the existence and necessity of God for moral imperatives and ethical obligations between <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-vwnzqOo\">theologians and atheologians</a> alike may never cease, secular humanism offers <i>at least one</i> pragmatic alternative to a religious worldview by providing a normative cynosure of values, ethics and meaning with which to structure the lives of atheists and other nonreligious peoples.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4532\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4532\" style=\"width: 237px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tomflynn.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4532\" alt=\"Tom Flynn\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tomflynn-237x300.jpg\" width=\"237\" height=\"300\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4532\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tom Flynn</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>In Thomas Coleman’s interview for the RSP with Tom Flynn, secular humanism is described as a “complete and balanced life stance” rejecting supernaturalism. Recorded at the Center For Inquiry’s <a href=\"http://www.centerforinquiry.net/oncampus/slcla2013\">2013 Student Leadership Conference</a>, Tom addresses whether secular humanism is a religion by covering the functionalist/substantive dichotomy, and discusses some of the common ‘tenets’ of secular humanism and outlines the growth of secularism, atheism and agnosticism in the United States. Tom departs by drawing parallels with current attempts in America from the LGBT movement, and their effort to gain acceptance, to that of the ongoing battle for equality, acceptance and ‘normality’ for nonbelievers in God leaving us with the following word of advice for atheists around the world: “If you’re in the closet come out”. This interview attempts to bring secular humanism under the academic eye of religious studies as a movement which should fruitfully be considered in discursive relationship to the category &#8216;religion&#8217;.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4517\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4517\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/554863_10151840200372265_1989740199_n.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4517 \" alt=\"2013 Center For Inquiry Student Leadership Conference \" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/554863_10151840200372265_1989740199_n-300x152.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"152\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/554863_10151840200372265_1989740199_n-300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/554863_10151840200372265_1989740199_n.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4517\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">2013 Center For Inquiry Student Leadership Conference</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_5390\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-4450-86\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/RSP88-flynn1.mp3?_=86\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/RSP88-flynn1.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/RSP88-flynn1.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/RSP88-flynn1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=4450-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/RSP88-flynn1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP88-flynn1.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('4450-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_4450-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_4450-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_5391&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-4450-87&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/RSP88-flynn1.mp3?_=87&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/RSP88-flynn1.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/RSP88-flynn1.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

In other words, do scholars of religion study something that forms a unique and special domain of <i>things</i> in the world unlike any other? Wittgenstein thought religion constituted a distinct “form of life”. Eliade spoke of the ‘Sacred’ as existing in a separate reality above the mundaneness of the everyday (i.e. the profane).  Historically and in more modern times, other scholars have held similar views that paint the category of religion as naming a specific and stable set of things in the world set apart from all other. However, it is a view that has fallen out of favour as noted by Dr. Russell McCutcheon.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1845538986/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1845538986&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\"><img src=\"http://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1845538986&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" alt=\"\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this interview with Thomas Coleman, McCutcheon discusses what he terms as the &#8220;socio-political strategy&#8221; behind the label of &#8220;sui generis&#8221; as it is applied to religion. The interview begins by exploring some of the terms used to support sui generis claims to religion (e.g., unmediated, irreducible, etc.) followed by a brief overview on the rise of religious studies departments mid-20th century using such claims to obtain funding and the autonomy from other disciplines. In closing, Dr. McCutcheon explains one example of how the ideological foundations of belief are ontology-centred, examines how the term religion is &#8220;traded&#8221; and departs leaving us to consider the role of social agreement in defining what religion <em>is</em> or <em>is not</em>.</p>\n",

All the muslims are supposed to know the Qur&#8217;an, although they don&#8217;t. Some of them have never opened it. Some of them don&#8217;t think they are Muslims. – None of us is Christian, Muslim, a Mason, Atheist, 24 hours a day. We have much more belongings, identities.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-3960 alignleft\" style=\"font-style: italic;\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo_Salzbrunn-300x200.png\" alt=\"Photo_Salzbrunn\" width=\"270\" height=\"180\" />Needless to say, migration and diasporic communities are a politically hot topic. In many European countries the attitudes towards immigration, especially by those representing different cultural or religious backgrounds, have become more critical and in some cases outright hostile. On the other hand, there are those who advocate openness without paying much attention to the challenges increased immigration as well as uninformed immigration policies may cause. The digging of ideological trenches and heated debates seem to highlight the very real need of comprehensive academic study on the realities of migration, immigrant communities, immigration policies and beyond. But how are these to be studied most effectively? One person who definitely has something to say about this topic is professor Monika Salzbrunn. She is currently the leader of the Research Institute for Social Sciences of Contemporary Religions (IRSSCR) and holds a full-time professorship in &#8220;Religion, Migration and Diaspora&#8221; at Lausanne University, Switzerland. She has been involved in an impressive array of research projects. For example, she was the leader of the French team in the European GEMMA project on policymaking, gender and migration in the 7th framework program of the European Union at Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS). The RSP had a great opportunity to discuss the broad themes of migration and diaspora with professor Salzbrunn at the biennial conference of International Society for the Sociology of Religion in Turku earlier this year.  Salzbrunn contributes the final episode to our current theme &#8216;Religion, Migration and Diaspora&#8217;, and tells about the work done at the IRSSCR. She gives an introduction to her current research projects, and also says something about what in her view remains to be done in the future. A point to emphasize, in her view, is that it is important to study the multifaceted everyday life of the &#8216;silent majority&#8217; to get relevant information on the religious diversity &#8216;on the streets&#8217;: food, entertainment, and especially the religious events and festivities, in which religious and ethnic identities are being constructed and maintained.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_191\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-3886-11\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RSP79-Salzbrunn.mp3?_=11\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RSP79-Salzbrunn.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RSP79-Salzbrunn.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RSP79-Salzbrunn.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=3886-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RSP79-Salzbrunn.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP79-Salzbrunn.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('3886-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_3886-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_3886-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_192&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-3886-12&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RSP79-Salzbrunn.mp3?_=12&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RSP79-Salzbrunn.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RSP79-Salzbrunn.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p align=\"left\">You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

They discuss how traditional Buddhist teachings are reinterpreted in order to harmonise their Buddhism with the multicultural society in which they are embedded, although this has not been uncontroversial. Buddhism, of course, has historically <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">been </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">geographically and theologically diverse, and this has continued in a North American context. </span></p>\n<p>They also discuss how these affect our<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\"> models of religion and culture. </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">Are the appropriations of Buddhist traditions like meditation in therapeutic contexts to be considered &#8216;religious&#8217;?

Dawson, 2007). Pretty much unprepared for the sensory feast of a Santo Daime ritual, I was visually struck by the colourful ‘uniforms’ and brightly decorated ceremonial space. The strongly rhythmical and fervently sung ‘hymns’ also made an impact, as did the powerful smell and bitter taste of the religious sacrament which practitioners call ‘Daime’. A psychoactive beverage more commonly known as ‘ayahuasca’, the sacrament of Daime and its psychotropic effects further added to the intense sensory stimulation which abides as an enduring memory of my earliest encounter with Santo Daime. Staged within the mountainous terrain of a national park hundreds of miles north of São Paulo, the ritual contents and format originally forged in the Amazon region of north-west Brazil did not seem particularly out of place. However, unlike the poor, mixed-race community which first elaborated Santo Daime as part of its semi-rural subsistence lifestyle, the ritual participants with whom I was celebrating were overwhelmingly drawn from Brazil’s predominantly white urban middle class. Whereas the uniforms, songs and sacrament were very much of the Amazon region, those wearing, singing and consuming the ceremonial accoutrements of Santo Daime certainly were not. By no means discordant, the juxtaposition of Amazonian origins and urban-professional appropriation nevertheless piqued my academic interest.

These themes are also picked up and developed in a recent volume published by Ashgate &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1409456773/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1409456773&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\">Social Identities Between the Sacred and the Secular</a> &#8211; which was co-edited by Abby, Chris, and Giselle Vincett.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Wearing one of her other hats, Abby also presents regularly on how to build an academic career, win research funding, and get articles published, and has published the books <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-academic-publishing-roundtable/\">academic publishing</a> and <a title=\"Roundtable: Building an Academic Career\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/building-an-academic-career/\">building an academic career</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_197\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-3947-17\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP76-Day.mp3?_=17\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP76-Day.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP76-Day.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP76-Day.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=3947-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP76-Day.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP76-Day.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('3947-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_3947-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_3947-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_198&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-3947-18&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP76-Day.mp3?_=18&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP76-Day.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP76-Day.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p align=\"left\">You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

In discussing the many ways that this relationship can unfold David touches upon broader issues of interest to religion scholars like the place of imagery within religious traditions. Prohibitions against certain types of religious images can, for instance, pose challenges to comic book artists desiring to tell certain kinds of religious stories. He also delves into the superhero archetype, and discusses how the comic book genre is particularly suited to tell stories of a mythological character.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">And what does any of this have to do with Scientology?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\"><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_201\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-3875-21\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP74-Lewis.mp3?_=21\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP74-Lewis.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP74-Lewis.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP74-Lewis.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=3875-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP74-Lewis.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP74-Lewis.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('3875-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_3875-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_3875-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_202&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-3875-22&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP74-Lewis.mp3?_=22&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP74-Lewis.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RSP74-Lewis.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></span></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "content": "<p>Religion and Food are two elements which one rarely sees receiving extended and combined scholarly attention. However, even the briefest of brainstorms yields a wide variety of examples which could be &#8220;brought to the table&#8221; (to use a pun from today&#8217;s interview).</p>\n<p>Some interactions involve the consumption of food &#8211; think of the traditional image of the Jewish <em>Shabbat</em> or Hindu <em>Diwali</em> celebrations; others involve restrictions &#8211; be that in terms of diet (such as Jain vegetarianism) or food intake (such as the Muslim month of <em>Ramadan</em>). The Roman Catholic celebration of the Eucharist might be conceptualized as the intake of food and drink by some, whilst others may find this whole notion deeply offensive, preferring to understand these elements as the body and blood of Jesus Christ. And this discourse can be perpetuated in ostensibly &#8216;secular&#8217; contexts, such as the recently reported release of the new &#8220;Ghost Burger&#8221; at Chicago&#8217;s Kuma&#8217;s Corner restaurant, <a href=\"http://www.nbcchicago.com/entertainment/the-scene/kumas-corner-chicago-ghost-burger-226280991.html\">made with a red wine reduction and topped with an unconsecrated Communion wafer</a> (thanks to Sarah Veale of <a href=\"http://invocatio.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/mysteria-misc-maxima-october-11th-2013/\">Mysteria Misc.

Connections are made with recent turns in the academic study of religion (gender, materiality etc.), and other areas of study such as religion and nutrition/health.

His earlier post was in Département de sciences des religions at Université du Québec à Montréal, Canada. He is also researcher at the Groupe Société, Religions, Laïcités (GSRL-EPHE-CNRS, Paris) and the Chaire de recerche du Canada en Mondialisation, citoyenneté et démocratie (UQAM). Gauthier&#8217;s research interests include topics related to e.g. religion and politics and religion and public space. Apart from consumerism and neoliberalism, he has studied topics such as religiosity in rave culture and the Burning Man festival.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ashgate.com/images/9781409449782.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://www.ashgate.com/images/9781409449782.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"170\" height=\"256\" /></a>Together with Tuomas Martikainen, he has edited two books, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00E8GOOKE/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00E8GOOKE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\">Religion in Consumer Society</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1409449785/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1409449785&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-20\">Religion in the Neoliberal Age: Political Economy and Modes of Governance</a> both of which were published earlier this year in the Ashgate AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society series.

My French is awful, but this is in Switzerland. Previously he has been based in Quebec in Montreal, and he’s been doing empirical research on subculture, countercultural phenomenon, and today we are talking especially about religion and consumer culture, consumer society and neoliberalism. Welcome.</span></p>\n<p><b>François Gauthier:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Thank you very much for having me. Yes, so basically the economic question came up because I was doing studies on those phenomena, and also on new political phenomena. Protests happening in the mid 90’s that led to the anti-globalization movement, and up to today’s Occupy movement. What I saw is that subcultures self-defined against consumerism, and political movements, new political movements had changed radically since the 70s. In the 70s, it was all about taking power… Maoist guerrilla types of terrorist action, whether it be in Quebec or in Germany or elsewhere, and it was linked with the Arab struggle and stuff like that, the anti-imperialist movement. Starting with the 90s, well, we have these subcultures that are very festive. All the sudden, political protest becomes festive. What’s that? Instead of having a confrontation with power, it was “Let’s open areas of autonomy,” with respect with the State. In a way, it was not about confronting the State, but it was more calling the State back to its public, what </span><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/grace-davie-on-the-changing-face-of-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grace Davie</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would call “public utility”. It was saying, well the State, you have to regulate markets. Basically, what I already intuitively knew, what that the world was governed by a new force that was not political, but was economic. So I started, first of all, challenging political theory, and challenging religious theory, from the margins, saying that theory available today did not allow us to understand these phenomena. Ravers say this is spiritual. This can’t be dealt with [available] theory. What’s wrong with the theory? While most people were doing the contrary, they were saying “This is not religion”. They say it is, but it’s not. But it’s massive, and it still happens today. If ravers say they’re religious, it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t fit our definition. I took the contrary way in saying that the problem is the definition. The problem is not the ravers. And if the ravers feel that Catholicism and raves are on the same level, then they are. (5:00) It’s the sociologist that has the problem, not the ravers. That was a starting point, and the same thing with the political theory side. So basically, it was the realisation that a major factor in understanding these phenomena was understanding that we were no longer under a sort of political model, a Nation-State regulating political model, but that there was a new regulation, a new world that was emerging, that was essentially governed by economics. And that therefore there were, and there are, religious dimensions to economics, and political dimensions to economics. So how do we understand that? As of the last… these last fifteen years have been the development of that initial intuition…</span></p>\n<p><b>HL:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So, basically a new power’s come into play or has kind of strengthened, and what happened is that the scholars of religion still look at it kind of from the </span><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2013/02/20/post-westphalianism-versus-homogenization-theories-of-globalization-and-religion-by-jillian-scott/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Westphalian Nation-State</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> point of view. And these new arenas that these religions are taking up do not fit the categories that the State has kind of institutionalised for religion. And this is what we have a problem with, scholars of religion.</span></p>\n<p><b>FG:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Exactly. Exactly. Yes. Just a kind of liminal methodological word. I’m French, and I’m from French theory where </span><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/ivan-strenski-on-emile-durkheim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Durkheim</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Marcel Mauss are still quite important. Actually, Marcel Mauss has become to be important anew. And Marcel Mauss refused to separate sociology and anthropology. He was one of the founders of French sociology, and the French sociologists were the first to, and the only ones to, use sociology as a word, because Weber self-identified as an economist, so when you are talking about sociology, this is what you’re talking about. An this founder of French sociology basically his discourse meant, what he meant by we need not separate, we must not separate sociology and anthropology, is because sociology is concerned with societies, which itself defines as being something like modern societies, bureaucratic societies, with differentiated social spheres. And so it implicitly says that, with respect to every other culture in the world that’s ever been and today the West, there is sort of a great shift. So it postulates a uniqueness. This is the basis for many secularisation theories and many evolutionist theories. Mauss was very aware that this was dangerous. There is a specificity to modern societies, Western societies, and now web societies worldwide, but there are certainly not in complete discontinuity with other so-called archaic societies or societies that existed before. On the other side, anthropologists who study the Other, the archaic so-called primitive societies, the simple societies. You have two normative trends in anthropologists. Either you discredit the primitive societies as being infants that will eventually grow into adults. Or on the contrary you idealize the Natives by saying “This is great, everything is meaningful and peaceful, and now we’ve gone into these modern societies’. And so you have a disenchantment narrative. If you keep both modern societies together with so-called primitive or archaic societies, and you’re always thinking “How do I differentiate what I’m looking at, with respect to the first societies?’, and “Where do I find continuity?” As a point of method, I think this brings a lot of fresh water. It avoids of seeing too much continuity, and the same time it avoids seeing too much difference. So I always read contemporary phenomena while thinking ‘How does this relate to Siberian shamanism in the early 1900s?”, “How does this relate to (10:00) Brazilian Amazonian forest Yanomamis?”, and, even if I’m looking at contemporary Judaism or whatever, I do this. And I tell my students to do this. And I tell them “Put the book, put Malinowski on your table, and once in a while, after you go to the toilet or have a coffee, just open any page and read it. And then close it”. Just to keep that in mind. So that sort of also sketches my approach to contemporary societies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the issue of consumerism or economics within culturally regulated system, the two books that we just published with Thomas Martikained, </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00B5SPTDO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00B5SPTDO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Religion in the Neoliberal Age</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1409449866/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1409449866&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Religion in Consumer Society</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These are two books, but actually they’re one book. On the one hand, this has not been done before, not at all, even in economics or in sociology, is to think neoliberalism, not only as a dominant political ideology, or an economic theory, but also as a cultural ideology, and asking why did this theory that looked completely crazy in the 1940s, and was almost totally dismissed, has no… promises no utopia, has no [positive] value to it at all, has become so self-evident today and dominant. At the same time, consumption… the age that you have, and the age that I have… we grew up in this. This is obviously one of the major traits of societies today. But you will not find this to be opening statements in books on work, family, religion, law. So this is what we started the book saying, for book one, saying “We live in a neoliberal era”, and the other book, by saying “We live in consumerist societies”. These are not the only traits, but these are very, very important defining traits of our societies today. How did this grow up? How did this occur? In the post-Second World War period, which was a rapid growth period after the Second World War, for about three decades, this is when Nation-State really developed into a welfare state. And what happened also in the economic level at the same time is that production, since the crash of 1929, could no longer pull the economy. That was one of the reasons behind the crisis. Marketing was invented, meaning “We need to create needs, and we need to create consumption, and then production will follow.” So when Max Weber is writing in the early 1900s about economy, he’s writing about a productive industrial economy. But that only applies in part today, because since at least the 1950s and 1960s, we’re living in post-industrial society in which it is no longer production that is pulling the economy, but consumption. And this type of society emerged slowly during the 1960s and 1970s, and really started to be dominant within people’s lives in the 1980s. The 1968 riots in California, May ‘68 in France… if you look at what is claimed, it was not as much of a political revolution as a cultural revolution, and the values of liberty and autonomy, those are also those of consumer capitalism. This was instilling itself. One of the theories, one of the hypotheses we have, is by the time Deng Xiaoping in China, deregulates the inner market, by the time that Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan come in and start applying free market policies, it’s not just a question of “Okay, there were four crises in 1973, and 78”. It’s not just because of the inflation and all that. It became widely popular as  a way of governing societies, because people had become accustomed over thirty years of having an economic rapport to life. (15:00) That you can buy services, you can buy vacations, you can buy all these things. Even from the 1950s in the United States, what marketers have found out is that the economy does not function according to laws of&#8230; the laws of offer and demand. It has nothing to do with it, or very little in the end. What is driving is that it is no longer what the washing machine can functionally do, because there are seventeen or eighteen other brands that are doing exactly the same thing. It’s in the name of the things marketers, which… can’t remember his name right now&#8230; it’s what the washing machine will do for your soul. It’s not what car you will drive, it’s what this projects, how does this project or express who you are? Cigarette brands… Malboro was a woman’s cigarette until I think the 1940s. Then all the sudden they rebranded it, with the Malboro man and that become of the most successful brand name operation in the world. It has nothing to do with the product. It’s the fact that when you’re smoking Malboro’s, and today they rebranded it with more of a hipster content, you’re buying an identity. You’re not buying identity in a commodification way, you’re really, you’re buying signs, that you’re putting out towards the world saying who you are. If consumerism worked, it’s because of that. And because we’re modern individualistic societies, and what individualism is about is that you are unique. You are different than anybody else in the world. This is a radically new way to see, to conceive humanity, and to conceive subjectivity. It’s radically new. But how are you going to do that? In the 1900s, there was a romantic movement, in the elite aristocratic and literary elite could function within that ethos, but with consumer society, starting with the 1950s and 1960s, it got massified, then it meant that anybody could create his own self, in a way. Or at least, participate in certain identities and certain lifestyles, because people are good enough with their own liberty that they can really create their own look. You can only buy the clothes that are in the shops. Consumerism is all about choice, but, right now, if you want baggy jeans, you going to be looking for a long time for baggy jeans, better go to second hand stores, cause everything that is available is tight jeans. You see that it’s a choice, that’s always at the same time determined by what’s out there, and somebody determined this stuff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what we were basically saying is that you cannot separate neoliberalism and consumerism, because they work together, and you can’t understand the rise of neoliberalism if you don’t understand that it’s rooted also in the conditioning that being consumers, as the condition that’s happened within the social… and then we talked of other phenomena. The fact that we used to talk about governmentality in politics which meant authority, hierarchical structures, and taking political decisions and values into actions. Today, we talk of governance. Try not to use the word governance, which is more of a market model, horizontal, procedural, consensual way of functioning politically. That has come into the fore. And nobody today in political science writes govermentality, everybody writes governance. There is an ideology behind that, there is a shift, a huge shift in [imagining…]. And then take management, which today, universities, the economics and marketing schools in our university are by far the most populated, the most popular. They didn’t exist at the end of late 1970s. There was not marketer before 1995, I think, that was actually trained as a marketer. And today, it’s the very heart of our universities. We have to realize this, and this goes into, if you’re taught management, and massive parts of that, massive amounts of our contemporaries (20:00) are being trained in management, it makes you think in a management way. And this is why all the sudden you’re managing your stress, you’re managing your love life, you’re managing absolutely everything within your life and this in an economic way of viewing things. So what we’re trying to do with these books is say “You cannot understand what’s going on if you don’t link all this up. You can’t look at just public policies, and neoliberalism as a doctrine. You cannot look at it only philosophically.” It doesn’t help. It’s much more profound and anthropological, and it relates on every level going from high level policies at the UN, how this is implemented in how the world bank functions and all that. And in the very and most privatized aspect of everyday life, and how people choose how to dress every day, and how they decide on their consumption choices, because even the type of coffee you drink is a way of showing who you are.</span></p>\n<p><b>HL:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, because obviously what we were saying earlier about the mix and match approach, which I’ve come across a lot, a lot of people talk about how religion, as you say, your choices are not, and they mean something, always, and they construct you as you are, and that’s why you have to put off weight on it, basically. Then religion is no exception. This has been noted by many scholars, that it is a big identity thing, as well as this kind of spiritual… you can choose, say you can do yoga, you can go to some nice Christian retreat, you can do all these things and that kind of also constructs your identity. But so, you’re saying that there is no mix and match. Could you elaborate on that?</span></p>\n<p><b>FG:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Absolutely, your question is excellent and it comes perfectly in mind with what I was saying before. Religion is not a thing, it is related to different contexts, different societies and different cultures. Shamans… shamanistic cultures in Siberia, I mean there are no spirits, there is no belief, there is no scripture, no god. There is just “how do we manage to kill elk?” It’s much more complicated than that, but it’s just to kind of open our mind to what religion is. With that consumerist shift, what’s happened is that religion has changed, but we’re so used to thinking of religion as being the church, or something that is separated within social sphere. The church is a certain place, there [are] certain people who take care of that, and there are certain times where you go. And it also relates to either a local level belonging and identity, and then national level of identity. We are so used to that that we think this is normal. But if you go back to a country like Quebec in the early 1800s, it was not like that. Catholicism wasn’t even important, that became important in the mid-1900s. So if it changed before, why can’t it change radically now? </span></p>\n<p><b>HL: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly</span></p>\n<p><b>FG: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so, if you get that perspective, you stop having to think about religion disappearing or coming back or whatever. Now, societies have changed and religious change is an important factor in that change. Today, religion has morphed into tribal belongings, lifestyle-type of belongings, mediated namely through the virtual sphere, but also the local level on a person-to-person basis in collectivity. These are overlapping levels. So religion has become less involved about correct belief and belonging to a set community, it’s more about ethics. ‘How do you live your life?’ If I’m a Muslim, I will eat </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">halal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and avoid </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">haram,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and I will wear a veil if I’m a woman, and do this, and the five prayers. This wasn’t important in Islam, twenty, thirty, forty years ago. This was not important. This has become important since that economic shift that changes religion towards ethics and identity. (25:00)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, your question was about the pick and choose. How do you analyze that? Many scholars have talked about this as being </span><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/an-interview-with-veronique-altglas-on-bricolage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">à la carte</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, people choose their religion, they mix and match</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this and that, it’s sort of light, it doesn’t have many incidences, and therefore sort of degraded form of religion. This is sort of what is involved in this kind of thinking. The subtext of this is saying that this type of religiosity is sort of not real religiosity. And the second thing that it is saying is that this is not structured, it’s fragmented, it’s incoherent, it’s amorphous. In the end, it doesn’t really make sense. Another line of argument, that sort of touches on to this, has been thinking of religion in economic terms. There is a religious market, and people pick and choose, and there are laws of offer and demand, and all this. The first narrative, the one that says that things are fragmented, and all this, basically, it’s trying to think within the same categories of what religion was before, and so what it is seeing it that it looks fragmented, because it’s looking with the eyeglasses of what it used to be. We’ve heard that loads in this conference. It’s been a huge debate and it’s starting to change. I think that there are new ways emerging, and I think that this conference is probably, in Turku, is probably one of the moments where the discipline is shifting. The other way, the second part that sees rational choice theory and that kind of salvation goods, or looking at the branding of religion, these are interesting insights, but when you look at what they really do, is that they completely lose specificity of religion and they treat religion as any other product, being a Mars bar or buying a vacation on Club Med, and nobody has ever asked the question “Is religion really that much of a product?” The basic flaw, and this has perhaps not been said enough, cause there’s been loads of debates on rational choice and even important people, intelligent people, have given rational choice way too much credit in my view. Rational choice must be absolutely avoided at all cost. Why? Because it’s not understanding this new way of religiosity, it’s not understating the relationship between a consumer neoliberal type of society, with respect to religious change. It’s interpreting religious change in economic terms. And it’s doing so saying that, basically, it’s always been the case. Well, I’m sorry. Yanomami religion, Siberian shamanism, 1930s Catholicism in Quebec, or Lutheran Christianity in Finland, did not&#8230; was not an economic decision of maximizing utility with the laws of offer and demand. It was not that. So the question is “Why did these theories emerge?” Actually, the theories emerged because we are in a economic driven society. This is the only thing that rational choice theories hint us. They tell us where we should be looking, we should be understanding that we don’t have to think religion in economic terms, we have to see how the society has changed, where economy is being structuring&#8230; has become structuring, and religion changes in rapport with this. What we’re proposing is a radical sidestep outside of rational choice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if I may pursue the line of argument that was crossing my mind&#8230; is that </span><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-linda-woodhead-on-the-secularisation-thesis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">secularisation theory</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, meaning the decline of religion, the decline of social functions of religion, the privatization of religion within the private life, the separation from the public sphere, religion becoming a differentiated social sphere that basically has relationships with the rest of the social spheres, but that keeps to itself, this kind of thing. And then the debates on “Is religion returning?”. </span><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/grace-davie-on-the-changing-face-of-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It went away and now it’s returning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Basically these debates have come to criticise secularisation theory in a way that I think, the great majority of sociologists of religion today (30:00) would sort of agree that secularisation doesn’t work anymore to think today. But nothing has emerged yet that can present itself as being the new paradigm. One of the problems is that we’ve been so scared of general theory, because the general theories we had until Parsons and Luhmann, and that kind of stuff, was basically trying to explain everything from theory. And so, it didn’t work with the facts and people rebelled against that. Today, we’re on a very contrary, we’re on the contrary of the 1960s, where, today, and that’s the question we get all the time, is that, “Yes, but what about specific local context?”. Well, of course there is a specific local context, but the problem is nobody’s thinking the link between the fact that yoga has become a major site of spirituality/religiosity today, in Western countries, and that Islam is totally reshaped by Islamic televangelists all over the world, including the Arab world and Indonesia, and that these televangelists are not religiously trained, they’re businessmen types. And Julia Howell was talking about that in the plenary this morning. And this is totally redefining Islam. Nobody connects these dots, and tries to show how this frames. Everybody’s looking at all the variegated aspects within national contexts, but nobody’s trying to grab that globally and transnationally and showing that, well, if you sidestep and look at things a certain way, all of the sudden, these things seem structured, all of a sudden you start seeing the links Burning Man festival, festivals of the Senegalese Sufis in New York. So, this is what we are attempting to do. We’re not saying it applies absolutely everywhere, because it’s tied to the logics of globalization, where has  the market, and where has the Internet and all that reached. Where Internet, the marketing and consumerism have reached, this is where you will find this type of change in religiosity. And this is not fragmented, this makes a lot of sense, this is very much structured. But then, it expresses itself in different parts of the world in amazing manners that are sometimes quite different, but at the same time sometimes quite similar. For example, these Islamic televangelists in Indonesia hired Texan Pentecostals to help them build their thing. So there’s more and more of these transnational movements that are all collaborating to structure religion in this new way.</span></p>\n<p><b>HL:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is hugely interesting. I’m just listening in awe, I’m not even coming up with anything to say, really. I’m afraid we don’t have much time left and we have to close this interview. Pack it up. I have one more question, a question I tend to ask always. And that is what next?</span></p>\n<p><b>FG:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What next? Today, in Turku 2013 ISSR conference, I would say that what next is to not do once again the same normative and ideological mistake we did with the secularization theory. Secularization theory was bound to a certain type of religion, and to a certain way of seeing religion that was Christian-oriented. This way of looking at things devalued women, it didn’t look at what women we’re doing, but women were doing stuff, and devalued non-institutional phenomena as being irrelevant. What we’re saying today is that women are foremost in religious change, and that the non-institutional stuff is probably the most important today, and the institutions are changing in relationship to the non-institutional. So the secularization paradigm was stuck in modern ideologies, stipulating that religion was going to stay what it was, and therefore decline because there was modernisation equal </span><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-lois-lee-on-non-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">non-religion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (35:00) There is a whole lot of debate around this. It’s an ideological frame that left a lot of stuff out, and what can we do with the “What now?” is “How do we avoid doing that again?” Obviously, any type of paradigm, any type of general theory of understanding the world will leave stuff behind. But you can try not to be too stupid about it, and in my view, one of the major challenges today comes from the idea of </span><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/an-interview-with-kevin-w-gray-on-the-postsecular/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post-secularity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Post-secularity is the greatest threat to sociology of religion today. Why? Because it stipulates secularization, says it’s an after, first of all. Second, it’s it was coined by </span><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/michele-dillon-on-habermas-religion-and-the-post-secular/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Habermas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who was a philosopher, and is mostly concerned with a rationalist and public-space bias. This is a philosophical discussion, it’s not a sociological description of societies. So it looks sexy, but actually it shouldn’t be a sociological concept. And another main thing is that in all of this discussion on post-secularity, at least most of it, the essential core if it&#8230; stays within the secularisation in the Nation-State frame, what things used to be, politics and religion being the two self-structuring&#8230; the two structuring spheres, and it does forget about economy. It says nothing about the fact that we live in consumer societies. Habermas has absolutely nothing to say about neoliberalism except the Frankfurt critiques of the 1960s. This has never thought of how consumption is different from production, it has not entered their mind, they haven’t thought the Internet out, and they’ve especially forgotten women and culture. So even if you are paying attention to economics and culture within this frame of post-secularity, you’re still continuing to miss what’s happening. I think what the challenges in “what now?”, is “Let’s try not to be as stupid. Let’s try not to be as ideological,” and let’s go into this very exciting period which is the redefinition if the paradigm through which we’re going to study religion. And of course, we think we’re right, saying that you must pay attention to the ideologies of neoliberalism, consumerism as an ethos, and the relationship of all this with hypermediatization and real time technologies, which in places like Africa, remote places of Africa, where they don’t even have normal telephone lines and electricity, they have cellular phones now. They have one set of pants, one set of shirts, and a cell phone. And so even the places that don’t seem like they are relevant to this type of analysis… you can ask the scholars on the field ,as I do, as much as I can, and this </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> relevant. This is very very relevant.</span></p>\n<p><b>HL:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you very much.

    "content": "<p>Throughout the history of the RSP, we have been privileged to feature a number of interviews and responses which have focused upon the interaction of &#8216;religion&#8217; with information and communications technology, including Jonathan&#8217;s interview with <a title=\"Tim Hutchings on Digital Religion\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-tim-hutchings-on-digital-religion/\">Tim Hutchings on Digital Religion</a>, and Louise&#8217;s interview with <a title=\"Heidi Campbell on Religion in a Networked Society\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-heidi-campbell-on-religion-in-a-networked-society/\">Heidi Campbell on Religion in a Networked Society</a>. However, up until now, we haven&#8217;t paid particular attention to the impact of social media upon &#8216;religion&#8217; and Religious Studies. Today&#8217;s interview features Chris speaking with <a href=\"http://paulinehopecheong.com/\">Pauline Hope Cheong</a> of Arizona State University on the topic of religious authority, the impact of social media upon this aspect of religion, and how scholars can potentially go about utilizing this seemingly infinite repository of information and chatter in their research.</p>\n<p>As Cheong herself writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Given its rich and variable nature, authority itself is challenging to define and study. Although the words “clergy” and “priests” are commonly used, in the west, to connote religious authority, the variety of related titles is immense (e.g. “pastor,” “vicar,” “monk,” “iman,” “guru,” “rabbi,” etc). Studies focused on religious authority online have been few, compared to studies centered on religious community and identity. Despite interest and acknowledgment of the concept, there is a lack of definitional clarity over authority online, and no comprehensive theory of religious authority&#8230; (2013, 73)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hopefully this interview shall go some way to addressing this lack.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_207\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-3807-27\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP71-Cheong.mp3?_=27\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP71-Cheong.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP71-Cheong.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP71-Cheong.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=3807-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP71-Cheong.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP71-Cheong.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('3807-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_3807-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_3807-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_208&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-3807-28&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP71-Cheong.mp3?_=28&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP71-Cheong.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP71-Cheong.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

In this interview with Chris, recorded in July in Edinburgh, Carole provides a broad introduction and overview of the study of religion and cultural production, making particular reference to her recent publication, <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-alex-norman-on-spiritual-tourism/\">Alex Norman</a>, and featuring chapters from many of our contributors, including our own <a title=\"David G.

Mesopotamian urban centres developed from large temple complexes, Greek drama emerged from religious festivals dedicated to deities including Dionysos and Athena, and in more recent times Christianity has inspired musical masterpieces including the ‘St Matthew Passion’ by the Lutheran Johann Sebastian Bach (1686-1750), the motets of the Catholic William Byrd (1540-1023), and the striking paintings of the Counter-Reformation Spaniards Ribera, Zurbaran, and Murillo in the seventeenth century (Stoichita 1995). Nor can we forget the cinematic renderings of biblical story in such works as William Wyler’s epic <em>Ben Hur</em> (1959) starring Charlton Heston, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s (1922-1975) <em>Il Vangelo Secondo Matteo</em> (1964), or Mel Gibson’s <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> (2004). The Indian religious tradition contributes the magnificent Hindu and Buddhist temples of Angkor (Cambodia), and the exquisite Chola bronze statues, and the many extraordinary renditions of the India epics the <em>Ramayana</em> and <em>Mahabharata</em> onto the small and large screens. Likewise, Islam too has generated the sophisticated Timurid illustrated manuscripts of Firdausi’s Shahnama, the paintings of the various Rajput kingdoms, and from Sufi traditions the devotional <em>qawwali</em> music. Architecturally, perhaps the most obvious cultural products of Islam for those in the West has been the Islamic architecture of Spain such as the Alhambra and the Great Mosque or Cordoba, both now sitting as beautiful cultural legacies (Lapunzina 2005). Many more examples could be adduced, including forms of dance, systems of education, theories of government, special diets, and modes of costume and fashion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clearly there is no shortage of data for scholars wishing to delve into this broad topic. But what do we actually mean by &#8216;cultural product&#8217;? How can we claim that &#8216;religion&#8217; is producing these things in any meaningful way? What can we ascertain about a &#8216;religion&#8217; from its cultural products? And what makes this approach different from that of <a title=\"David Morgan on Material Religion\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-david-morgan-on-material-religion/\">Material Religion</a>? This broad-ranging interview tackles such questions, and more, via examples as diverse as religious celebrity, Rudolf Steiner&#8217;s Goetheanum, and Sacred Trees and finishes by addressing whether or not the &#8216;secular&#8217; university &#8211; and, in turn, Religious Studies &#8211; can be seen as a cultural product of a particular form of Christianity.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_209\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-3779-29\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP70-Cusack2.mp3?_=29\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP70-Cusack2.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP70-Cusack2.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP70-Cusack2.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=3779-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP70-Cusack2.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP70-Cusack2.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('3779-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_3779-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_3779-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_210&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-3779-30&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP70-Cusack2.mp3?_=30&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP70-Cusack2.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP70-Cusack2.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "content": "<p>Welcome back! Our inaugural podcast of the new semester brings you two short interviews on the subject of historical approaches to the study of religion, recorded by David Robertson at the Open University&#8217;s Contemporary Religion in Historical Context conference in Milton Keynes, July 2013.</p>\n<p>First up is John Wolffe, who gives us an overview of the approach, its strengths and weaknesses, the impact that the internet has had on historical research and the shift towards &#8220;new history&#8221; which focusses on the marginalised over the powerful. Professor Wolffe also describes how one of his recent projects was planned and executed,which should prove valuable to those of us planning historical research. He also extols the role of historical research in uncovering &#8220;hidden histories&#8221; which can undermine constructed and confrontational narratives of historical identity.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" id=\"irc_mi\" style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; margin: 0px 5px;\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bd/The_Triumph_of_the_Moon.jpg/200px-The_Triumph_of_the_Moon.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"257\" />In the second half, Professor Ronald Hutton of the University of Bristol gives a more in-depth case-study, talking about his book on the emergence of Wicca, <a href=\"http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780192854490\"><em>The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft</em></a> (OUP, 1999), and how it was received by the academy and by the pagan community. Of particular interest here for the interviewer was the fact that, although sections of the book are often given to undergraduate students, they somehow seem to prefer Gerald Gardner&#8217;s own fantastical account of initiation into a pre-Christian Moon-goddess cult over Hutton&#8217;s more down-to-earth &#8211; yet no less fascinating &#8211; account.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_211\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-3050-31\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP69-Historical.mp3?_=31\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP69-Historical.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP69-Historical.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP69-Historical.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=3050-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP69-Historical.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP69-Historical.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('3050-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_3050-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_3050-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_212&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-3050-32&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP69-Historical.mp3?_=32&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP69-Historical.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/RSP69-Historical.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>Thanks to the Open University for supporting these and other recordings.</p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "excerpt": "<p>&#8220;History can be of tremendous value for a society that is looking for roots&#8230; and can sometimes be a bit uncritical in its search for roots. People want an identity and may be clutching at something that can be a bit confrontational, for example, Muslims looking for an identity rooted in current conflicts in the Middle East, rather than reflecting on what is quite a long-standing presence in British society and culture.&#8221;</p>\n",

What do we recognize as essential and specific to any given faith, and why? In this lecture, I address these questions by drawing on fieldwork among humanists in Britain, paying particular attention to humanism’s relation to Christianity. In one way or another, humanists often position themselves in relation to Christianity. In a basic way, this has to do with humanists’ commitment to secularism—the differentiation of church and state. In more complex ways, though, it also has to do with an effort to move “beyond” Christianity—to encourage a world in which reason takes the place of revelation—while often, at the same time, recognizing what’s worth saving and even fostering from the legacies of faith. All these various relations and perspectives suggest how we should understand social life in contemporary Britain as what it is in spite of Christianity—and not.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Engelke has recently completed a year of ethnographic fieldwork in the offices of the British Humanist Association [BHA] and is soon to publish his findings. As part of this research project Dr Engelke worked with BHA accredited celebrants and also trained as a funeral celebrant. This work leads the way for a happily increasing number of similar research projects and this will be further encouraged by the recent launch the <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/anthropology/research/PRNR/Home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Programme for the Study of Religion and Nonreligion</a> at LSE, which is coordinated by Dr. Engelke .</p>\n<p>The full text of this lecture is <a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/RES-000-22-4157/outputs/read/933e529e-a881-4ac2-9b7b-324f94acb06a\">available to download here</a>.</p>\n",

For the past year, I (David) have kept a file where all the little amusing bits that didn&#8217;t make it into the weekly episodes got put.

His thesis, under the supervision of Professor Kim Knott, focuses upon the lived relationships between the concepts of ‘religion’, ‘nonreligion’, and the ‘secular’, and their theoretical implications for Religious Studies. In 2011, he completed his MSc by Research in Religious Studies at the University of Edinburgh, on the topic ‘Toward a Typology of Nonreligion: A Qualitative Analysis of Everyday Narratives of Scottish University Students’. Chris has published on contemporary atheism in the&nbsp;<em>International Journal for the Study of New Religions</em>, is Editor and Bibliography Manager at the <a href=\"http://nsrn.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network</a>, and co-editor (with Abby Day and Giselle Vincett) of the volume <a href=\"http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409456773\"><em>Social Identities between the Sacred and the Secular</em></a> (Ashgate, 2013).

Publications include “Making the Donkey Visible: Discordianism in the Works of Robert Anton Wilson” in C. Cusack &amp; A.

Research has focused on a wide range of topics, including different religions in virtual worlds; religion and video games; online cyber-churches and temples; and an exploration into how religious organisations and individuals are accepting or rejecting digital media. Heidi Campbell is one of the leading scholars in the field of media, religion and culture and has written extensively about this topic; providing us with an insight into the relationship between digital culture and religion. For scholars of religious studies, media studies and other related disciplines, the exploration of religion and the internet provides an insight into the relationship between religion and technology and consequently, the possible impact and challenge to traditional religion.</p>\n<p id=\"E25\">On a recent visit to Edinburgh, the Religious Studies Project (Louise) met with Heidi Campbell (the interview is set in a restaurant and so on occasion you may hear some background noise). The interview focuses on her recent article in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion (March 2012), &#8220;Understanding the Relationship between Religion Online and Offline in a Networked Society&#8221;, which presents five key traits of the concept of &#8220;networked religion&#8221;. These are: networked community; storied identities; shifting authority; convergent practice; and a multisite reality. Campbell presents an overview of each of these traits and concludes by questioning how digital communications technologies might affect religious authority in the future.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_223\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2696-43\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP64-Campbell.mp3?_=43\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP64-Campbell.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP64-Campbell.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP64-Campbell.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2696-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP64-Campbell.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP64-Campbell.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2696-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2696-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2696-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_224&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2696-44&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP64-Campbell.mp3?_=44&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP64-Campbell.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP64-Campbell.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p id=\"E67\"><span style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;\">You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on </span><a style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a><span style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;\">.

Certainly there are plenty of examples of where serpents have been power symbols both in totem and ritualistic traditions.  Moreover, many of the world’s population identify with serpent play as a potentially dangerous exercise. Within this risk potential, the serpent carries a variety of different auspicious meanings related to culture and/or the impermanence of life. The Southeast United States is no exception. The Appalachian Mountain region of the Southeast was geographically isolated in many parts from the rest of the United States until recently. This isolation coupled with the challenges of a rural socio-economic lifestyle created uncertainty within the minds of many inhabitants. Religious beliefs and practices provided meaning and certainty within an uncertain world. Serpent Handling traditions of Appalachia were no exception.</p>\n<p>Serpent handling as a religious practice appeared within the first decade of the twentieth century. The practice emerged in east Tennessee and spread to other parts of the Southern Appalachian Mountain region of the United States. While many different groups, both Holiness and Pentecostal, enact the practice, the serpent handling groups themselves have no parent organization that binds them together. What binds the groups together is a sharing in diversity of belief with similar religious practices (Burton, 1993 pg. 20-21). Serpent handling sects are historically and philosophically linked to three forms of American Protestantism: Holiness, fundamentalism, and Pentecostalism, although typically many groups would identify their membership as Holiness (Hood, found in Brown &amp; Mcdonald, 2000). The fundamentalists influence among serpent handlers is in their acceptance of a plain reading of the Bible when it is appropriate (Hood, Hill, &amp; Williamson, 2005).</p>\n<p>As handling serpents began spreading throughout the Southern Appalachians, the notoriety of serpent bite deaths increased (Hood &amp; Williamson, 2008). Much of the public fascination with these traditions relates primarily to the dangerous practice of handling of serpents or drinking of poison as part of the religious ritual. Many outsider observers assume that serpent handling traditions are of one religion or of a single theology. Such an assumption cannot be further from the truth. Many of the churches diverge on issues of textual interpretation of the Bible and theology. Their only unifying practice is dictated within Mark 16. For those within these traditions, handling of serpents or drinking of poison is an issue of religious freedom. Most states have enacted laws outlawing the practice of serpent handling. Regardless of the legal discrimination or the physical risk to themselves, the serpent handling sects assume the risk to follow God’s commandment (Hood, 1998).</p>\n<p>In this week&#8217;s podcast, Chris Silver and Dr Paul Williamson explore Williamson&#8217;s research, and by proxy his colleague <a title=\"Podcast: Ralph Hood on Mysticism\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2013/05/20/podcast-ralph-hood-on-mysticism/\">Ralph W. Hood Jr. (see our podcast from 2 weeks ago)</a> related to documentation of the Serpent Handling Sects of Appalachia. By some accounts these traditions are in decline due to globalization. Williamson has attempted to study these traditions qualitatively and quantitatively to better understand the profound sense of religious commitment and deeper meaning of the theology and practices of the Serpent Handling sects.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_225\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2642-45\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP63-Williamson.mp3?_=45\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP63-Williamson.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP63-Williamson.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP63-Williamson.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2642-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP63-Williamson.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP63-Williamson.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2642-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2642-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2642-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_226&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2642-46&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP63-Williamson.mp3?_=46&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP63-Williamson.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RSP63-Williamson.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

Paul Williamson is professor of psychology at Henderson State University (USA), although he has not always been in academic research. He was previously a full-time clergy in a Pentecostal denomination for 17 years, but then became more interested in religion from a psychological perspective. This led to his studies at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where he earned a Ph.D. in experimental psychology with training in both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. Applying these approaches to the psychology of religion, he has published work in the areas of mysticism, religious fundamentalism, Christian serpent handling, and, most recently, spiritual transformation within the context of substance abuse recovery. He has co-authored <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EWDGYA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001EWDGYA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-20\"><i>The Psychology of Religious Fundamentalism </i></a>(2005, Guilford Press), with Ralph W.

It typically is either from the objective standpoint <i>or</i> from the subjective point of view. What is needed for a more complete understanding of a particular phenomenon is the blending together of both perspectives in the use of quantitative <i>and</i> qualitative methodologies.”</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown, Fred &amp; Mcdonald, Jeanne (2000). <i>The serpent handlers: three families and their faith</i>.

Buildings dominate our skylines, they shape the nature, size, sound and smell of events within their walls, they provide a connection to the recent and distant past, and they serve as a physical, material instantiation of any number of contextual discourses. But what about the relationship between &#8216;religion&#8217; and these (generally) human-made structures? How does a building become recognized as in some sense &#8216;religious&#8217;? What other information do we need to infer things about the purpose of a building? About its impact? This week&#8217;s podcast features Chris talking with Dr Peter Collins about these sorts of questions, during the BSA SocRel Conference in Durham (April 2013). This sociology of religion conference occurred within a Chemistry department, at one of Britain&#8217;s most historic universities, in the vicinity of Durham Castle, and the magisterial Durham Cathedral&#8230; unsurprisingly, the built environment had a significant impact.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_227\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2646-47\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP62-Collins.mp3?_=47\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP62-Collins.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP62-Collins.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP62-Collins.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2646-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP62-Collins.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP62-Collins.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2646-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2646-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2646-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_228&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2646-48&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP62-Collins.mp3?_=48&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP62-Collins.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP62-Collins.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/09/24/podcast-kim-knott-on-religion-space-and-locality/\">Kim Knott on Religion, Space and Locality</a> and Katie Aston&#8217;s essay entitled <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/09/26/finding-space-for-nonreligion-further-possibilities-for-spatial-analysis-by-katie-aston/\">Finding space for nonreligion?

Mysticism has been observed within a variety of traditions and philosophies from Neo-Platonism to Hinduism and Christianity. Mysticism as a field of study is pregnant with possibilities for academic inquiry, both cross-disciplinary and discipline specific. The field of psychology is one of those disciplines which have sought to explore the richness of individual claims of mystical experience. This has been done with theoretical depth and methodological sophistication and is centralized within a variety of tools of empirical inquiry.</p>\n<p>The study of mysticism necessitates addressing issues of ontology and epistemology, relating to the methodological processes for studying direct personal experiences. Within the psychological perspective, some of these concerns are mediated through what both Porpora (2006) and Hood, Hill and Spika (2009) describe as methodological agnosticism. While Silver (2011) argues that there is no such thing as true objectivity in research, certainly academics and researchers can strive for a post-positivist paradigm of objectivity where they attempt to remove bias and subjectivity from their research or hermeneutic inquiry.</p>\n<p>While there is plenty of hermeneutic and observational potential in the study of Mysticism, more needs to be done in exploration of the experiential and psychological correlates related to personal experiences. Dr. Ralph W. Hood Jr. has extensive experience in the field of psychology of religion and particularly in the study of mysticism and mystical experience. As an early pioneer in the renaissance of the field of psychology of religion, Hood&#8217;s work is extensive and prolific exploring a variety of research topics in the social sciences of religion. Moreover, much of his collaborative work extends beyond the field of psychology to include sociology, religious studies, medicine, and a variety of other disciplines in the social scientific study of religion. In this week’s podcast, Chris SIlver is joined by Ralph Hood to discuss in detail his work on mysticism and the benefits and disadvantages of this academic exercise.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_229\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2618-49\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP61-Hood.mp3?_=49\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP61-Hood.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP61-Hood.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP61-Hood.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2618-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP61-Hood.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP61-Hood.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2618-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2618-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2618-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_230&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2618-50&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP61-Hood.mp3?_=50&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP61-Hood.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RSP61-Hood.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

Whether we are talking about the recent Boston Marathon bombings, the funeral of Margaret Thatcher, the Arab Spring, or the recent critique of the UK government&#8217;s welfare policy levelled by four major British churches, the ways in which the media negotiates, constructs and engages with this complex category has an enormous impact upon public opinion and understanding, and is increasingly relevant to academics, religious practitioners, journalists and the wider public. It was with this in mind that the Religious Studies Project, in collaboration with the <a href=\"http://jrmdc.com/\">Journal of Religion, Media and Digital Culture</a>, presented a panel session at the British Sociological Association&#8217;s <a href=\"http://socrel.org.uk/call-for-papers-socrel-annual-conference-material-religion/\">Sociology of Religion Study Group</a> Conference in Durham on 10 April 2013. This panel session brought together Eileen Barker, Tim Hutchings, Christopher Landau and David Wilson, who each have a unique position on this topic by virtue of their positions working with or for the media, to discuss and reflect on a recent edited volume by Jolyon Mitchell and Owen Gower &#8211; aptly titled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1409420191/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1409420191&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\">Religion and the News</a>.

    "content": "\n<p>Within modern American society the meme of a separation of Church and State exists without a doubt; however, there is very little evidence to actually prove that this separation exists, functions as such, or indeed that it ever existed. In the textbooks, popular news outlets and in the political arena religion is supposed to be wholly withheld-expelled in favor of majority rule. However, when we turn our attention to state-managed organizations such as the federal prisons or state forest services or support for military veterans, we find that the lines are blurred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an eye to this seemingly ironic phenomenon <a href=\"http://www.indiana.edu/~relstud/faculty/sullivan.shtml\">Winnifred Fallers Sullivan</a>&nbsp;presented a lecture entitled “Ministries of Presence: Chaplains as Priests of the Secular” at Arizona State University as part of the ASU Center for Religion and Conflict’s lecture series. Excerpted from her upcoming book of the same title, Sullivan considers the oversight, regulation and licensure of religious chaplains within the American Veterans’ Administration, as well several other governmental and on-governmental institutions. In this interview with Chris Duncan (Arizona State University), the discussion centers predominantly on the world in which many chaplains come to find themselves due to a “new kind of religious universalism”; from having to be prepared to minister across the borders of their own religious traditions, as in the case of a Catholic chaplain being required to assist Jewish or otherwise non-Catholic practitioners in a federal prison or a chaplain working with the state of Maine Warden Service. Sullivan asks whether we really have a separation of the Church and the State, how do we insure that everyone’s religious needs are being met within secular institutions like the Veterans’ Administration, and how does the State license and approve of applicants to the chaplaincy- how does, should, could an ostensibly secular federal organization approve or disapprove of religious ministers within its ranks.</p>\n",

In this interview, Christopher Cotter and Teemu Taira discuss the relevance of study of religion in the media from the religious studies point of view as well as the media discourse on religion – the ways in which media covers religion, functions as defining what counts as religion and negotiates its social location. Dr Taira points out the possible contribution of religious studies, addresses some methodological questions in studying religion in the media, examines media’s approaches to religion, and finishes with a look at the potential futures of the area of study.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_237\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2443-57\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP55-Taira.mp3?_=57\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP55-Taira.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP55-Taira.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP55-Taira.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2443-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP55-Taira.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP55-Taira.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2443-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2443-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2443-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_238&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2443-58&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP55-Taira.mp3?_=58&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP55-Taira.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP55-Taira.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

Taira’s current project examines discourse on religion and the secular in the Finnish media.

This February, he came to Edinburgh University to deliver the annual Gifford Lecture Series, established in 1888 to &#8216;promote and diffuse the study of Natural Theology in the widest sense of the term&#8221; &#8211; an opportunity we felt we could not miss. Previous presenters have included such luminaries as William James, Wilfred Cantwell Smith and E. B. Tylor. So how does an anthropologist of science come to be giving the Gifford Lectures?</p>\n<p>In this first part, Latour and David Robertson discuss the broader relevance of his work for Religious Studies. They discuss actor-network theory, of which Latour was instrumental in developing. This includes some discussion of phenomenology and religious &#8220;essence&#8221;. Discussion then moves to Latour&#8217;s forthcoming work, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/074566007X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=074566007X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\">Rejoicing: or the Torments of Religious Speech</a> (Polity 2013), a more personal work which concerns not &#8220;religion&#8221; or &#8220;religions&#8221; but the adverb &#8220;religiously&#8221;. What does it mean to talk <em>religiously</em>, and is it still even possible? It is at the same time a fierce attack on religions, but a passionate defence of religious speech.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_241\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2453-61\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP53-Latour-Part-1.mp3?_=61\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP53-Latour-Part-1.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP53-Latour-Part-1.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP53-Latour-Part-1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2453-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP53-Latour-Part-1.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP53-Latour-Part-1.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2453-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2453-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2453-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_242&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2453-62&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP53-Latour-Part-1.mp3?_=62&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP53-Latour-Part-1.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RSP53-Latour-Part-1.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

But the world of publishing can be esoteric, especially the cloistered world of academic publishing. In this special roundtable discussion, recorded during the Australian Association for the Study of Religion annual conference last year, Zoe Alderton leads a group of academics with experience of all levels of academic publishing in a discussion which aims to demystify the process.</p>\n<p>George, Zoe and Carole begin by talking about editing special themed Issues of academic journals. They talk about networking &#8211; that you have to make yourself available, but you have to put the work in when it&#8217;s needed. Alex then describes how a larger edited book is constructed from the proposals received. Simon then describes his experience of <em>writing</em> for an edited volume. Alex shares a cautionary tale about authorship and competition, and Carole recounts some less-than-positive experiences with editors.</p>\n<p><a style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AnnabelCarole.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2414 alignright\" style=\"border-color: #bbbbbb; margin-top: 0.4em; background-color: #eeeeee;\" title=\"AnnabelCarole\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AnnabelCarole-202x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"182\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AnnabelCarole-202x300.jpg 202w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AnnabelCarole-691x1024.jpg 691w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AnnabelCarole.jpg 1228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Conversation then turns to the experience of being an editor yourself. George reads an email which he composed in order to reject someone as kindly as he could. Carole&#8217;s closing advice is &#8220;Write what you want, and write clear.&#8221; This podcast is essential information not only for prospective Religious Studies scholars, not only the humanities and social scientists, but anyone aiming for a career in academia.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Zoe for chairing this, to Carole and Don for opening their home, and to Annabel Carr for providing photographs.

    "content": "<p>As one of the earliest forms of Personality Assessment, the Myers Briggs Type Indicator or MBTI was first formally published in 1942 by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers. Inspired by the theoretical richness of Carl Jung, the MBTI explored and celebrated the differences of people regarding their behavior. The structure of the MBTI makes the assumption that behavior is innate in various forms and that people have dominate and – in some theories of personality – recessive behaviors which are automatic and inherent. Psychological Type theory has four sets of binary choices related to personality. Those are two orientation types defined as extraversion and introversion, two perceiving functions described as sensing and intuition, two judging functions defined as thinking and feeling and two attitudinal perspectives described as judging and perceiving. These four binary choices produce sixteen possible personality types.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/robbins.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2381\" title=\"robbins\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/robbins-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>Research has explored a variety of perspectives regarding personality type particularly in exploration of the intersections and division of innate characteristics from socially conditioned characteristics. Even more, some research has shown that some recessive binary opposites emerge within adverse environmental conditions indicating a much more dynamic nature to Personality Type than originally thought in earlier academic literature. Personality Type Theory and Psychometrics has become a popular mainstay in a variety of academic and applied disciplines. Certainly one can find the MBTI in use in a variety of settings from medical to education. Psychology certainly has benefited from the application of Personality Type in a variety of ways. The field of Psychology of Religion is no exception. Certainly one can find continued focus and utility in the extensive works of scholars such as Leslie J. Francis at the University of Warwick in the U.K., Mandy Robbins at Glyndŵr University in Wrexham, UK as well as Christopher F. J. Ross at Wilfrid Laurier University and others who find depth and exploration in the recondite study of psychology of religion.

As the field of psychometrics becomes increasing complex so too are the arguments against classic and traditional measures. Within some circles of psychology and psychology of religion in particular, personality type has met with recent scrutiny in comparison to other theories of personality such as the Big Five. Concerns over issues of statistical validity and measurable complexity come to mind. Many of those who fall within the Big Five camp regarding trait versus type theory find fault or concern with the binary structure of MBTI. Moreover, many of the detractors certainly have a valid argument as the data of the Myers Briggs Type Indicator functions much differently than more recent parametric measures such as the Big Five Domain. The Big Five domain has at the heart of its psychometric assumption the expectations of parametric normality meaning the data plots within a ubiquitous bell curve structure. For the MBTI especially in traditional forms of the assessment, certainly the data was either dichotomously based or in some forms percentage of agreement based (where analysis requires a nonparametric alternative such as Chi-Square). Based on these observations many psychometric theorist assumed the MBTI was not psychometrically valid as an assessment of personality. Certainly parametric attempts have been made to create alternative measures of personality. One of the fruitful products of Dr Francis’ work has been a measure of personality type which is scored and analyzed within parametric analysis. This research has reconfirmed the utility and usefulness of the Myers Briggs within not only within psychology but the field of psychology of religion as well.</p>\n<p>While the debate is based in the operationalization of method and analysis in many respects, those who favor the Big Five certainly miss the richness of description related to each of the sixteen personality types. Moreover, the depth of Jungian theory is lost on a newer more statistically focused generation who seeks to quantitatively measure and account for human phenomena numerically as opposed to holistically. The work of Mandy Robbins and her colleagues still hold true to concerns with grand theory and the depth of human experience. This podcast explores the work of Mandy Robbins within the field of Psychology of Religion through the use of MBTI and similar measures. She explores the complexity of individuals and how their personality type can be descriptive of the types of people who call themselves religious and/or spiritual.</p>\n<p>Mandy Robbins gained her first degree at the University of Wales, Lampeter in 1992 in Theology and Archaeology, her MPhil in Theology at Trinity College, Carmarthen in 1996, and her PhD in Theology at the University of Wales, Bangor in 2002. In 2005 she completed a post-graduate diploma with the Open University in Psychology. Mandy is also qualified as an MBTI practitioner. She worked as a junior research fellow at Trinity College, Carmarthen 1995-1999. From there she moved to the University of Wales, Bangor as teaching and research Fellow 1999-2007. In 2007 she moved to the University of Warwick as senior research fellow before moving in 2011 to Glyndŵr University as senior lecturer. She is managing editor of <em>Rural Theology: International, ecumenical and interdisciplinary perspectives</em> and also serves on the editorial boards of <em>Welsh Journal of Psychology</em> and <em>Journal of Religious Education. </em>Mandy’s research interests are within the field of the psychology of religion and include the beliefs and values of young people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, personality theory and clergywomen in the Church of England. Mandy’s research employs mainly quantitative methods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Recent publications</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Robbins, M.</strong> (2008). <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0773449485/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0773449485&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therelistudpr-21\">Clergywomen in the Church of England: A Psychological Study</a><em>.</em> Edwin Mellen: New York, ppi-237, ISBN 978 0 7734 4948 5.</p>\n<p>Francis, L.

Taves challenges traditional models of religious experience, rejecting both an essentialist approach with a sui generis category and a constructivist approach which accepts only discourses. Instead, she argues that not only can we examine unusual experiences in themselves, as they affect individual agents. From there, we can examine how these experiences become reified and institutionalised by specific traditions, as well as providing impetus for new religious movements. Taves&#8217; work utilises historical and ethnographic methods in an attempt to establish an approach which might allow cross-cultural and diachronic analysis of unusual experiences without recourse to specific theologies.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_247\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2366-67\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RSP50-Taves.mp3?_=67\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RSP50-Taves.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RSP50-Taves.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RSP50-Taves.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2366-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RSP50-Taves.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP50-Taves.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2366-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2366-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2366-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_248&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2366-68&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RSP50-Taves.mp3?_=68&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RSP50-Taves.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RSP50-Taves.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "title": "Faith Development Theory",
    "content": "\n<p>Within the field of psychology, extensive research has explored a variety of themes related to development theory from humanism to cognitive. Much of research focuses on graduated stages which indicate a change in complexity both in behavioral as well as cognitive growth. Other theories of development have even focused on ethical development as related to the individual and their community. James Fowler’s Stages of Faith is an excellent example of the convergence of a variety of developmental theories and models into a single theoretical paradigm of faith. Fowler believed that individuals change and grow in their faith much like they develop in learning or behavior. He suggested six stages of development which can be applied to people. The earlier stages are related to learning and relationship with one’s inner community while the later stages speak to the issues of ethics and social awareness. Fowler&#8217;s work has been celebrated by theologians, religious educators, and professionals as a milestone in the study of faith and religion. Fowler&#8217;s work also serves as a template upon which to structure the education of youth and the tailoring of ministry programs in the identification of their faith development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all accounts, many see Fowler&#8217;s work as a classic text, however, it is not without controversy. Within some circles of psychology of religion and religious studies, Faith Development has been all but abandoned. The work utilizing Fowler&#8217;s stages appears mainly in theological empiricism or pastoral care. There are some exceptions however. Enter Heinz Streib of Bielefeld University. Over ten years ago, Streib saw applicability to Fowler&#8217;s stages, but not in their typical empirical application. Heinz realized that Fowler&#8217;s descriptions had descriptive utility in how individuals structure and formalize their belief, but he also recognized that the graduated method of “stages” was empirically and culturally problematic. Particularly, some individuals seek a defined and close knit group identity within their religious tradition and would likely not be concerned with the social justice for others of different faiths. Moreover, from a cognitive perspective, such individuals are also just as happy with simplistic forms of meaning and an authoritarian theological tradition. For Streib, these systems of meaning were not passé or scant in any way, only different. Streib proposed “styles of faith” based in Fowler, but with the fluidity for individuals or progress and digress, faith becomes a much more dynamic process. This podcast explores Dr. Streib’s work on Faith Development, Faith Styles, and his current research in the field of Psychology of Religion.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>There can&#8217;t be many listeners who haven&#8217;t come into contact with the &#8220;World Religions&#8221; paradigm, either through the podcast or in their own undergraduate studies. The idea that we can classify religious traditions into a hierarchical schema goes back to the earliest days of anthropology and sociology. Although, C. P. Tiele defined &#8220;World Religions&#8221; as those which had spread outside of their original cultural context, today the term is taken to mean the &#8220;Big Five&#8221; — Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism. Frequently this is complimented by Indigenous Religions and New Religious Movements. Yet despite the fact that this approach originated in the Victorian era under the influence of colonialism, it is still the dominant framework in pedagogical approaches to the study of religions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet this categorisation assumes a number of problematic criteria. Most obviously, it favours &#8220;traditions&#8221;, and especially those which have straddled more than one ethnicity. Secondly, there&#8217;s an implicit weighting towards religions with books, temples, founders and other things which can be easily quantised &#8211; and perhaps not coincidentally, like Christianity. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it assumes that &#8220;religion&#8221; is a thing which can be recognised and catalogued, and not a term which is mostly concerned with the exercise of power, as scholars such as Chidester, Asad and McCutcheon have argued. Is the World Religions paradigm, then, as Max Müller argued, simply how &#8220;the vast domain of religion must be parcelled out&#8221;? Or, as Terry Thomas put it, is it less a case of &#8220;know thy enemy&#8221; as &#8220;know thy trading partner&#8221;? To discuss this important issue, we were delighted to invite back Professor James Cox.</p>\n",

In the social sciences these discourses focus primarily on explanations of violent acts that are driven by the socio-political contexts enveloping them. Mark Juergensmeyer argues that such explanations only tell part of the story, however, since some actions are motivated by a religious vision, like the vision of “cosmic war.” Talking to Per in this podcast Juergensmeyer explains how a “sociotheological approach” is particularly well suited to the task of understanding religious violence by engaging the worldviews of violent actors directly and taking their theological concerns as seriously as their political ideologies.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_251\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2176-71\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP45-Jurgensmeyer.mp3?_=71\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP45-Jurgensmeyer.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP45-Jurgensmeyer.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP45-Jurgensmeyer.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2176-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP45-Jurgensmeyer.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP45-Jurgensmeyer.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2176-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2176-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2176-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_252&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2176-72&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP45-Jurgensmeyer.mp3?_=72&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP45-Jurgensmeyer.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP45-Jurgensmeyer.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

But the world is still here; and so is religion, although religion could rarely be described as unproblematic. In this interview with Chris, Douglas Pratt &#8211; Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Waikato, New Zealand &#8211; asks:  &#8216;Why is religion so persistent?&#8217; What are we to make of contemporary problematic issues, such as extremism and terrorism, often associated with religion? What might the Taliban in Afghanistan, Anders Breivik in Norway, and the Christchurch Cathedral in New Zealand, have in common, for instance? And why should scholars care?</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_253\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2255-73\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP44-Pratt.mp3?_=73\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP44-Pratt.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP44-Pratt.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP44-Pratt.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2255-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP44-Pratt.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP44-Pratt.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2255-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2255-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2255-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_254&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2255-74&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP44-Pratt.mp3?_=74&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP44-Pratt.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RSP44-Pratt.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

From the recent upsurge in worldwide visibility of Mormonism due to the widespread attention given to the religious identity of Mitt Romney (the Republican Candidate in the 2012 US Presidential elections), to the huge success of the<em> Southpark </em>creators&#8217; hit musical <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Mormon_%28musical%29\">The Book of Mormon</a>, </em>there is no shortage of ill-informed opinion surrounding this group. Unsurprisingly, the academic study of religion has its own questions about Mormonism: can it be described as a New Religious Movement? Is there a unified phenomenon which can be classified as Mormonism? Is Mormonism to be considered as a form of Christianity? This week, Chris is joined by Ryan Cragun &#8211; Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Tampa, Florida &#8211; to discuss not only these conceptual issues, but issues relating specifically to quantitative research, Mormon demographics, and the worldwide growth and decline of the LDS Church.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_255\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2224-75\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RSP43-Cragun.mp3?_=75\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RSP43-Cragun.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RSP43-Cragun.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RSP43-Cragun.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2224-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RSP43-Cragun.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP43-Cragun.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2224-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2224-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2224-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_256&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2224-76&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RSP43-Cragun.mp3?_=76&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RSP43-Cragun.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RSP43-Cragun.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

However, we are sure that every listener will find something of interest in these recordings, and wish you happy listening over the &#8216;Christmas&#8217; period.</p>\n<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know the NSRN, the Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network is an international and interdisciplinary network of researchers founded in 2008 which aims to centralise existing research on the topic of non-religion and secularity and to facilitate discussion in this area. The NSRN run a series of events including their biennial conference and annual lecture series, in addition to maintaining <a href=\"http://nsrn.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a vibrant website</a> with extensive collection of resources, publications, and listings for teachers and students working in the area of non-religion and secularity.</p>\n<p>Due to the lecture style of these recordings, it is somewhat inevitable that the audio quality will be lower than we would like, and that there might be references to PowerPoint presentations or other events happening in the room. However, we know that these will be minor irritations when compared with the stimulating scholarship that you are about to hear, and we are very grateful to the NSRN for working with us to bring you these lectures.</p>\n",

Those of you who have been listening to the Religious Studies Project for some time will be somewhat familiar with the emerging sub-field of ‘non-religion’ studies. Perhaps you have listened to our <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/10/08/podcast-lois-lee-on-non-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">podcast with Lois Lee</a>, the founder of the <a href=\"https://thensrn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Non-religion and Secularity Research Network</a>, and wanted to know more? Or maybe you have heard Chris’s incessant &#8220;yes, but what about the ‘non-religious'&#8221;? question in interviews and roundtables and wondered what this all has to do with Religious Studies? Whether or not either of these happened, we hope that you will enjoy this roundtable discussion with Dr. Louise Connelly, Christopher Cotter, Dr. Frans Jespers, Ethan Quillen, Dr. Steven Sutcliffe, and Dr. Teemu Taira.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the suggestion of Dr. Steven Sutcliffe, Chris convened a group of scholars to discuss the study of non-religion within a Religious Studies framework. How do we define non-religion? What does such a demarcation have to offer our discipline? What is the scholar’s role in assigning labels such as ‘religious’ or ‘non-religious to individuals or groups who may eschew such labels? Are the ‘spiritual but not religious’ to be considered ‘non-religious’? And why would we even want to use the term ‘non-religion’ anyway? These questions and more form the basis of what became quite a lively discussion.</p>\n",

Cotter is a PhD Candidate at Lancaster University, UK. His thesis, under the supervision of Professor Kim Knott, focuses upon the lived relationships between the concepts of ‘religion’, ‘nonreligion’, and the ‘secular’, and their theoretical implications for Religious Studies. In 2011, he completed his MSc by Research in Religious Studies at the University of Edinburgh, on the topic ‘Toward a Typology of Nonreligion: A Qualitative Analysis of Everyday Narratives of Scottish University Students’. Chris has published on contemporary atheism in the <em>International Journal for the Study of New Religions</em>, is Editor and Bibliography Manager at the <a href=\"http://nsrn.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network</a>, and co-editor (with Abby Day and Giselle Vincett) of the volume <em>Social Identities between the Sacred and the Secular</em> (Ashgate, 2013).

His research  examines how UFO narratives became the bridge by which ideas crossed between the conspiracist and New Age milieus in the post-Cold War period. More broadly, his work concerns contemporary alternative spiritualities, and their relationship with popular culture.

    "content": "<p>James R. Lewis was kind enough to have a chat with us at the <a href=\"http://webappl.web.sh.se/EASR2012\">2012 EASR conference in Stockholm</a> despite having a sore throat due to a cold. Lewis has been involved in research on new religious movements (NRMs) since the early late 1980s and has both written and edited extensively on the subject. In this episode of the Religious Studies Project, Lewis shares some of his views on the study of NRMs. It seems, claims Lewis, that our current generalizations about who joins such movements is based on outdated statistics. It seems no longer to be the case that it is primarily young people who join NMRs, rather joiners’ age has increased during recent decades. This demonstrates why we need more and better quantitative data. James and Knut also talk a bit about the situation in Norway when it comes to research on NRMs.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_261\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2028-81\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RSP41-Lewis.mp3?_=81\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RSP41-Lewis.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RSP41-Lewis.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RSP41-Lewis.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=2028-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RSP41-Lewis.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP41-Lewis.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('2028-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_2028-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_2028-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_262&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-2028-82&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RSP41-Lewis.mp3?_=82&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RSP41-Lewis.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RSP41-Lewis.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/religious-studies-project/id495504655?mt=2\">iTunes</a>.

    "excerpt": "<p>Rudolf Otto was a highly influential figure in the history of Religious Studies, but whether that influence was for good or not is a debatable issue. His ideas about the sui generis nature of the religious experience and of an irreductible numinous or sacred foreshadow the work of scholars such as Eliade, but proved highly divisive for scholars and practitioners alike. </p>\n",

Two words that seemingly go together like hand in glove but just how accurate is that? When we talk about religion it&#8217;s very hard not to talk about the Sacred but when we talk about the Sacred does this mean we have to talk about religion? What does the Sacred even mean? This introduction began with &#8220;Sacred&#8221; but it may well be more appropriate to write &#8220;sacred&#8221;. Whether capitalised or not, the sacred is a predominant topic in many forms of discourse and not all these are necessarily religious in nature.</p>\n<p>This week we discuss the sacred and all its connotations with Gordon Lynch. The sacred is not, it seems, just a religion-only category and many aspects of modern secular societies are pervaded with such a notion. But if the sacred isn&#8217;t a religion only category where does that leave religion? Should there be departments of Religious Studies at all, or should we be replacing them with Sacred Studies? We discuss the potentially far reaching implications that a shift in focus from Religion to the Sacred can have on academia.</p>\n<div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_6333\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-1812-11\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/RSP36-Lynch.mp3?_=11\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/RSP36-Lynch.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/RSP36-Lynch.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/RSP36-Lynch.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=1812-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/RSP36-Lynch.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP36-Lynch.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('1812-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_1812-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_1812-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_6334&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-1812-12&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/RSP36-Lynch.mp3?_=12&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/RSP36-Lynch.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/RSP36-Lynch.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/11/07/christopher-r-cotter-secular-sacreds/\">Secular Sacreds and the Sacred Secular</a>.</p>\n<p>Gordon Lynch is the Michael Ramsey Professor of Modern Theology at the University of Kent where he teaches on the sacred in modern Western Society.

Many features of contemporary Druidry originated with Edward Williams (1747-1826), who took the bardic name Iolo Morganwg and founded the Gorsedd (gathering of Bards). It is difficult to determine a common element between the various groups, though many contemporary Druids recognise <em>awen</em>, the ‘inspiration’ of bards and Druids, and have an interest in trees and tree lore.

He tells how he first came over the German Folklorist Will-Erich Peuckert’s book <em><a href=\"http://books.google.no/books?id=VzsdAQAAMAAJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pansophie</a></em> (1936) and discovered a group of renaissance thinkers he had never heard of, but whose work evidently had influenced western culture in a profound way. It soon came to show that scholars in the academy wasn’t eager to go into it or take it seriously. Hanegraaf gives us insight to how this developed from being neglected sources of Western thought to an established field of study. He also goes into the question of definition; challenges and approaches within the study of Western esotericism; how the study of Western esotericism relates to the study of religion as a whole; the (non-)universality of esotericism; and additionally his blog <a href=\"http://wouterjhanegraaff.blogspot.nl/\">Creative Reading</a> and the accessibility of academic knowledge.</p>\n<div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_6337\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-1727-15\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RSP34-Hanegraaff.mp3?_=15\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RSP34-Hanegraaff.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RSP34-Hanegraaff.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RSP34-Hanegraaff.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=1727-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RSP34-Hanegraaff.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP34-Hanegraaff.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('1727-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_1727-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_1727-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_6338&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-1727-16&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RSP34-Hanegraaff.mp3?_=16&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RSP34-Hanegraaff.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RSP34-Hanegraaff.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-religious-studies-project/id495504655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

Millennial prophecy is often analysed with relation to violence and minority &#8220;cults&#8221;, but it is also infused into everyday discourse, in the rhetoric of politicians and the &#8220;rolling prophecy&#8221; of talk radio hosts. In this wide-ranging interview, David asks Gordon Melton about the history and reasons behind the fascination. <span style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;\">Discussion moves from the Millerites and the </span><a style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerism#The_Great_Disappointment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Great Disappointment</a><span style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;\"> of 1844, the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses and Mormons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries</span>, to <span style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;\">the Branch Davidians at Waco, Texas</span>.

    "content": "<blockquote><p>The two concepts of non-religion and secularity are intended to summarise <em>all positions which are</em><em> </em><em>necessarily defined in reference to religion but which are considered to be other than religious</em>. […This encapsulates] a range of perspectives and experiences, including the atheistic, agnostic, religiously indifferent or areligious, as well as some forms or aspects of secularism,  humanism and, indeed, religion itself. (Lee 2009)</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is fast becoming a tradition in ‘nonreligion’ research to acknowledge that Colin Campbell’s seminal call in <em>Toward a Sociology of Irreligion</em> (1971) for a widespread sociological analysis’ of ‘nonreligion’ had until very recently been ignored (Bullivant and Lee 2012). Although there has been a steady stream of output on secularisation, and more recently on atheism, these publications rarely dealt with ‘nonreligion’ as it is ‘actually lived, expressed, or experienced […]in the here and now’ (Zuckerman 2010, viii). One scholar who has been leading the way in theorising and empirically populating this emerging field is Lois Lee, the founding director of the <em><a href=\"https://thensrn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network</a></em>, who joins Chris and Ethan in this podcast, recorded in May 2012 in Edinburgh.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dr Lois Lee is Associate Lecturer in Religious Studies and Sociology at the University of Kent. Her work deals with theories of thought and action in differentiated and highly mediated societies, and her empirical research has focused on British nonreligious and secularist cultures. She is recently completed her doctoral thesis at the University of Cambridge and is currently developing the thesis into a monograph, provisionally titled, <em>Separating Sociologies: Religion, Nonreligion and Secularity in Society and Social Research</em>. She was guest co-editor of a special issue of <em>Journal of Contemporary Religion</em>, entitled  ’Nonreligion and Secularity: New Empirical Perspectives’, with Stephen Bullivant (January 2012). She has publications in (or forthcoming in) the <em>Annual Review of Sociology of Religion</em>, <em>Journal of Contemporary Religion,</em> <em>Studies in Ethnicity &amp; Nationalism </em>and <em>Critique and Humanism</em>, and will contribute to the forthcoming <em>Oxford Handbook to Atheism</em> (2013). Lois is founding director of the NSRN, the co-editor of its website, co-editor of the journal <em><a href=\"http://secularismandnonreligion.org/index.php/snr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secularism and Nonreligion</a> </em>(NSRN and ISSSC), and features editor for the LSE-based journal, <em><a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1473-8481\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studies in Ethnicity &amp; Nationalism</a> </em>(Wiley-Blackwell). She lectures and teaches the study of religion (and nonreligion), sociology of religion, social theory of modernity, introduction to sociology, and qualitative social research methods.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Lee’s basic definition of ‘nonreligion’ is ‘anything which is primarily defined by a relationship of difference to religion’ (Lee 2012, 131), yet related to this relatively simple definition are a host of conceptual, methodological and terminological issues. At an individual level, when they are given discrete options, many otherwise ‘non-religious’ individuals will inevitably self-categorise themselves using ‘religious’ labels (for a variety of different reasons, see Day 2011; Edgell, Gerteis, and Hartmann 2006). However, the labels that individuals utilise are rarely as important as the contexts in which they use them, their motivations for doing so, and the meanings attached to them. When permitted to select multiple (non-)religious identity terms, many welcome the opportunity to articulate multiple identities. Different identities may be enacted in different contexts (Cotter 2011b), and a superficial non-religiosity can mask beliefs and practices sometimes termed ‘spiritual’ by the individual in question. To complicate matters further, people are apt to utilise (non-)religious terminology in situations where their sacred values are (un)consciously called into question, yet for much of the time these sacred values and the associated terminology ‘lie dormant and, as such, invisible’ (Knott 2013).</p>\n<p>Institutionally, there are many organisations which can be explicitly labelled as ‘non-religious’, each exhibiting a collection of distinct-yet-interrelated attitudes and emphases (see Pasquale 2010, 66–69; Cimino and Smith 2007, 420–422; Budd 1977, 266), and in which much of what actually happens on the ground is arguably mundane and/or secular. However, the non-religious tend not to join specifically non-religious groups (Bullivant 2008, 364), and it is therefore unclear how representative these groups are likely to be. Other public institutions &#8211; such as a museum, a hospital chaplaincy, or a ‘religious’ NGO &#8211;  can be similarly ambiguous. ‘Religious’ institutions are utilised by non-religious people for a variety of reasons (Day 2011), and if we attend to the materiality and embodiment of public and private social interactions it becomes clear that a sound, a smell, or the mere presence of another person, can change the sacred, profane or mundane nature of (non-)religious and secular experiences.</p>\n<p>The ambiguities described in the previous paragraphs suggest that scholars attempting to engage with non-religion face particular terminological and methodological challenges. Terminologically, it is self-evident that the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘non-religion’ are ‘semantically parasitic categories’ (Fitzgerald 2007, 54). This relationship has led to a situation where the prevalent terminology used to refer to the non-religious in the social science of religion has often been ambiguous, imprecise, and even biased and derogatory (Cragun and Hammer 2011; Cotter 2011b; Pasquale 2007; Lee 2012). Methodologically, there is the attendant risk of constructing non-religion simply through the act of study. By asking questions specifically relating to (non-)religion, studies can exclude the possibility of (non-)religious indifference, whilst religion concurrently ‘serves as a “language” in which many people who may no longer be associated with any religious organisations still choose to express their strongest fears, sorrows, aspirations, joys and wishes’ (Beckford 1999, 25). The researcher must therefore be aware both of the limitations of the narrative interview, and of the different meanings attached to terms in different discourses (Stringer 2013). All of these issues and more are complicated by problems of locating potential research data for all but the most explicit forms of non-religion and by emergent problems in the assessment of religion-equivalent non-religious practices, and, indeed, the appropriateness of doing so (Cotter 2011a; Cotter, Aechtner, and Quack 2012)<strong>.</strong> This interview with Lois Lee addresses these issues and more, and provides a valuable reflexive discussion on what ‘nonreligion’ is, and why we might be interested in studying it from a Religious Studies perspective.</p>\n<p>The following quotation from Frank Pasquale serves as a suitable point of conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The closer people’s worldviews are probed – even among self-described secular or nonreligious individuals – the more difficult it is to neatly place many into the major categories that frame Western discourse on “theism” and “atheism” or “religion” or “irreligion” (2010, 63)</p></blockquote>\n<p>As we are all aware, study of ‘religion’ (and by definition, ‘nonreligion’) generally occurs within a Western, Christianised context which tends to assume a position of normative religiosity, and reify an academically constructed dichotomy between ‘religion’ and ‘nonreligion’. Whilst this interview (and many ongoing studies) focuses on one side of the ‘religion’-’nonreligion’ dichotomy, ultimately it can be seen as an attempt to ‘argue for the currently unfashionable side of [a] polar opposition, […] to unsettle the assumption that any polarity can properly describe a complex reality’ (Silverman 2007, 144).</p>\n<p>Listener&#8217;s may also be interested in our previous interview with Callum Brown on <a title=\"Editors’ Picks 1: Callum Brown on Losing Religion\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/07/30/editors-picks-1-callum-brown-on-losing-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Historical Approaches to Losing Religion</a>, and with <a title=\"Editors’ Picks 4: Linda Woodhead on the Secularisation Thesis\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/08/20/editors-picks-4-linda-woodhead-on-the-secularisation-thesis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Linda Woodhead on the Secularisation Thesis</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beckford, James A. 1999. “The Politics of Defining Religion in Secular Society: From a Taken for Granted Institution to a Contested Resource.” In <em>The Pragmatics of Defining Religion: Contexts, Concepts and Contests</em>, ed.

People have taken to creating digital avatars whether its to join in epic fantasy battles or simply to meet other people. And where you find people meeting you&#8217;re bound to find religion in the mix. Unlike chatrooms and blog posts where people simply write out their ideas and discuss their beliefs these digital worlds offer a whole new way in which to act out and practice religious beliefs. From meditation sessions, church congregations, to memorial services the range of activities not only matches what can be found in the real world but can exceed it also. The Digital realm opens up a whole new range of possibilities for a person to be religious.</p>\n<p>For many of us in the study of religions this may seem like a daunting task. The digital realm is a dark continent in which the standard practices of methodology and theory find themselves tested by a whole new landscape. To introduce us to the vast array of topics Tim Hutchings provides us with an introductory discussion into the world of digital religion. We discuss the ways in which religion is finding itself in the digital realm and how this new format of expression differs from its real world iterations. The digital realm poses a number of interesting challenges to the questions of religious authority and orthodoxy in ways not visible/possible in the real world. Finally we tackle some of the issues that we as researchers must face when we try and study digital religion like the methods of data collection and ethics involved in studying digital avatars.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_6339\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-1633-17\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RSP31-Hutchings.mp3?_=17\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RSP31-Hutchings.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RSP31-Hutchings.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RSP31-Hutchings.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=1633-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RSP31-Hutchings.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP31-Hutchings.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('1633-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_1633-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_1633-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_6340&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-1633-18&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RSP31-Hutchings.mp3?_=18&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RSP31-Hutchings.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RSP31-Hutchings.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-religious-studies-project/id495504655\">iTunes</a>.

And please, take moment to rate us.</p>\n<p>In the conclusion of her recent article in the journal <em>Religion </em>(2009), Knott asks ‘What are the scholarly merits of studying religion in local perspective?’ She replies:</p>\n<blockquote><p>An examination of specific places (whether physical, social or discursive) and localised religious groups, places and activities challenges the conception of ‘World Religions’ as unities focused on discrete, systematic sets of traditions, and normative beliefs and practices. In fact, it is possible that some religious people and organisations forged in particular localities become more interconnected and akin to each other than they are to those at a distance with whom they share a formal religious identity. [&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Studying religion in locality also signals a move away from the modernist regime of collecting, classifying and comparing data towards  seeing religion as a plural, dynamic and engaged part of a complex social environment or habitat that is globally interconnected and suffused with power. Re-engaging it with what has traditionally been seen as its ‘context’ helps us to reconnect ‘religion’ with those other categories – ‘society’, ‘politics’ and ‘economics’ – from which has been separated for the purpose of classification and study (Fitzgerald, 2007). In focusing intensively on particular bodies, objects, groups or places, we begin to see the difficulty and erroneousness of distinguishing ‘religion’ from other social fields in order to investigate it without meaningful reference to its context. Such an act of scholarly reconnection inevitably requires a multidisciplinary and polymethodic process that brings a researcher into engagement with others within and beyond the study of religions who approach the study of that body, object, group or place and what goes on within it from sociological, geographical, cultural, historical, anthropological and economic perspectives using a variety of fieldwork and textual methods.

It has been proposed that women explain their ‘religious’ experiences ‘in terms of protection [and] belonging’ (Day 2008, 274) and ‘value being caring and expressive, being a person through reciprocal relationships, and appreciate the value of improving the quality of subjective-life [in contrast to men, who concentrate] on improving the quality of life by way of autonomous, individuated and competitive agency in the world’ (Heelas et al. 2005, 110). Trzebiatowska extensively examines and critiques such explanations and concludes, with Bruce, that</p>\n<blockquote><p>the gender gap is not the result of biology but is rather the consequence of important social differences —responsibility for managing birth, child-rearing and death, for example, and attitudes to the body, illness and health — over-lapping and reinforcing each other. In the West, the gender gap is exaggerated because the social changes that undermined the plausibility of religion bore most heavily on men first. Where the lives of men and women become more similar, and where religious indifference grows, the gender gap gradually disappears.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For discussions on these issues and more, we recommend that you check out Marta&#8217;s other work, the references cited in this post, and the recently launched (2011) online journal <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/05/21/podcast-lisbeth-mikaelsson-on-religion-and-gender/\"> previous interview with Lisbeth Mikaelsson on Religion and Gender</a>.</p>\n<p>Dr Marta Trzebiatowska is Lecturer in the Department of Sociology at the University of Aberdeen. Her research focuses on &#8216;taking religion seriously&#8217; and on the relationship between religious discourses and gender politics. More specifically, she focuses on sociologically examining the ways in which religious women construct their femininity under circumstances commonly perceived as restrictive, or even oppressive, by secular feminists. She is the author of a number of articles and chapters in these areas, including <em>Habit does not a nun make?: Religious dress in the lives of Polish Catholic nuns</em> (Journal of Contemporary Religion) and <em>When Reflexivity is Not Enough: Researching Polish Catholics</em> (Fieldwork in Religion), and is co-author, with Steve Bruce, of the OUP Book <em>Why are Women more Religious than Men? </em>(2012).</p>\n<p>This interview is the second in our series on Material/Embodied Religion, which started last week with <a title=\"Podcast: David Morgan on Material Religion\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/09/10/podcast-david-morgan-on-material-religion/\">David Morgan on Material Religion</a>, and concludes next week with Professor Kim Knott on Religion, Space and Location.</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Aune, Kristin, and Giselle Vincett. “Gender Matters: Doing Feminist Research on Religion and Youth.” In <em>Religion and Youth</em>, edited by Sylvia Collins-Mayo and Pink Dandelion, 217–224.

Scholars such as Steve Bruce, Rodney Stark and Charles Taylor argued whether religion was becoming less important to individuals, or that only the authority of religions in the public sphere was declining. Data from the US and South America, however, began to challenge many of their basic assumptions. Professor Linda Woodhead joins us to discuss the background and legacy of the secularisation thesis.</p>\n<div id=\"powerpress_player_1137\"><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_6347\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-1477-25\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RSP-Eds-Picks-4-Woodhead.mp3?_=25\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RSP-Eds-Picks-4-Woodhead.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RSP-Eds-Picks-4-Woodhead.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RSP-Eds-Picks-4-Woodhead.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=1477-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RSP-Eds-Picks-4-Woodhead.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP-Eds-Picks-4-Woodhead.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('1477-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_1477-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_1477-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_6348&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-1477-26&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RSP-Eds-Picks-4-Woodhead.mp3?_=26&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RSP-Eds-Picks-4-Woodhead.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RSP-Eds-Picks-4-Woodhead.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-religious-studies-project/id495504655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.</p>\n<p>A transcription of this interview is also <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woodhead-Secularization1.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available as a PDF</a>, and has been pasted below <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/podcast-linda-woodhead-on-the-secularisation-thesis/\">the original posting of this podcast</a>. All transcriptions are currently produced by volunteers.

Prior to UMass, he received a 1958 A.B. from Harvard and a 1964 Ph.D from the U. Of California, Berkeley before rising from Instructor to Professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and serving as Executive Officer of the American Sociological Association. Among his many publications, he is author or editor of fourteen books, including the award-winning <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Crossing-Gods-Religions-Worldly-Politics/dp/0813532078/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344601296&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Crossing the Gods: World Religions and Worldly Politics</a> (2001) and the recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/SAGE-Handbook-Sociology-Religion/dp/1412911958/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344601352&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sage Handbook for the Sociology of Religion</a> (2008). The current Chair-elect of the Religion Section of the American Sociological Association, he is also past-President of the Eastern Sociological Society, the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, and the Association for the Sociology of Religion.</p>\n<p>Of particular relevance to this interview is his paper from 2000, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0021-8294.00001/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Varieties of Sacred Experience: Finding the Sacred in a Secular Grove</a>, from the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 39, p. 1–11. Here’s the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This paper contends that the social scientific study of religion has long labored under a chafing constraint and a misleading premise. It suggests that our primary focus should be on the sacred, and that religion is just one among many possible sources of the sacred. Defining religion “substantively” but the sacred “functionally” helps toresolve a long-standing tension in the field. Broadened conceptions of the sacred and of “sacralization” help to defuse the conflict among the two very different versions of secularization theory: the “all-or-nothing” versus the “middle range.” Meanwhile, a conceptual typology of the sacred pivots around the intersections of two distinctions (compensatory vs. confirmatory and marginal vs. institutional). This generates four distinct scenarios: the sacred as integrative, the sacred as quest, the sacred as collectivity, and the sacred as counter-culture. The paper concludes with three admonitions for research in the area.</p></blockquote>\n<div></div>\n",

The question cuts to the core of what academics who study religion are doing&#8230; are they taking care of religion? Are they antagonising it? What should they be doing? And judging by the various long tangents through which discussion meanders, the question certainly sparked our interest.</p>\n<p>The participants were Katie Aston, Anna Clot i Garrell, Christopher Cotter, Ting Guo, Ethan Quillen, David Robertson and Jonathan Tuckett (biographical statements below). All of us had listened to the bulk of the podcast mentioned above&#8230; BUT none of us had yet heard Russell McCutcheon’s response to it (so, apologies that we probably fall afoul of his excellent critique).</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_6355\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-1369-33\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RSP-roundtable-4.mp3?_=33\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RSP-roundtable-4.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RSP-roundtable-4.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RSP-roundtable-4.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=1369-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RSP-roundtable-4.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP-roundtable-4.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('1369-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_1369-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_1369-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_6356&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-1369-34&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RSP-roundtable-4.mp3?_=34&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RSP-roundtable-4.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RSP-roundtable-4.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>If you are new to the podcast – this is not <a title=\"Podcasts\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts\">what we usually do</a>.

We discuss the nature of the ‘sacred’, the idea of ‘<a href=\"http://www.criticalreligion.stir.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">critical religion</a>’, and get in to talking about ‘cultural Christians’, the ‘spiritual but not religious’ and the age-old problem of defining religion&#8230; and the newer but semantically parasitic problem of defining ‘<a href=\"http://nsrn.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nonreligion</a>’.</p>\n<p>We debate and attempt to answer such questions as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If our research uncovers material which is relevant to the real world… make sure that people know? Should we be public intellectuals?</li>\n<li>Should we just tell the truth no matter what the consequence?</li>\n<li>Does this discussion depend on which definition of ‘religion’ we work with?</li>\n<li>Where would we draw the line between being a scientific academic, and taking action against the conduct of a group we are studying?</li>\n<li>Are ‘we’ in a position to judge? Would we be judging from intellectual grounds or ethical grounds?</li>\n<li>Anna: What is the nature of academic criticism, as opposed to criticism in the common parlance?</li>\n<li>Should we be methodologically atheist? Methodologically agnostic? Are these the same thing?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1405\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1405\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cc14-e1342537798817.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1405\" title=\"cc14\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cc14-e1342537798817-300x179.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cc14-e1342537798817-300x179.jpg 300w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cc14-e1342537798817-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cc14-e1342537798817.jpg 1696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1405\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David and Anna showcase some hooded sweatshirts.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>We should warn you that this is a little rough around the edges. The idea was not to present anyone with a sophisticated discussion, but to give you an idea of the vast amount of issues which a simple question can raise, and encourage others to have such discussions themselves and maybe come to different conclusions. It’s uncensored&#8230; it’s fun&#8230; we had a good time. Please don’t take anything too seriously&#8230; but try to enjoy it, to engage with us, to disagree with us, to criticise us. That’s what we’re here for. There is also a lot of discussion of paedophilia&#8230; this came up early on as a hypothetically abhorrent practice which some ‘religious’ group might engage in. As it is pretty difficult to trump this in terms of abhorrence we returned to the issue somewhat more regularly than it warranted. Suffice to say, this was most definitely a hypothetical example.</p>\n<p>This podcast was recorded in Chris’ place of gainful employment – the <a href=\"http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/communications-marketing/visitor-centre/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">University of Edinburgh Visitor Centre</a> – and we are very grateful to them for providing the space. The participants were also all brought together by the <a href=\"http://www.religionandsociety.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Religion &amp; Society Programme</a>’s ‘Sacred Practice of Everyday Life’ conference, and we were very grateful to Linda Woodhead and the other organisers for allowing the Religious Studies Project to attend and record a number of podcasts with participants (to be released from September 2012).</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1404\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1404\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cc17.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1404\" title=\"cc17\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cc17-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cc17-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cc17-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cc17.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1404\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ethan: “When you define religion as a scholar, you’re essentially putting the last nail in your own coffin.”</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Some choice quotations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ethan: “so, essentially what you’re promoting is that we all need to be defence attorneys?”</p>\n<p>Chris: “Are we as scholars of religion by the very fact that we are scholars of religion&#8230; being caretakers?”</p>\n<p>Katie: “Can I just clarify that I’m not a scholar of religion?

In this regard, however, it is important to note: first, that the “linkage” between the knowledge produced and the problems resolved is “external,” that is, it is of the same order, so to speak, as that between the natural sciences and engineering; second, that even though religious studies research may be relevant in that fashion, working out the policy/resolution implications of that knowledge is not the task of the student of religion. To take on that assignment is the task of policy makers, politicians, therapists, conflict managers, and other “public intellectuals.” And it is important, I think, that the scientific character of the study of religion not be compromised in any way by bringing such tasks in to the purview of Religious Studies”</p>\n<p>Wiebe, Donald 2008. ‘The Scientific Study of Religion and Its Cultured Despisers’ in Willi Braun and Russell McCutcheon (eds.), <em>Introducing Religion: Essays in Honor of Jonathan Z.

    "excerpt": "<p>This discussion brings together a number of aspiring academics to reflect on some of the issues brought up in a recent podcast in a friendly and hilarious manner. The question cuts to the core of what academics who study religion are doing… are they taking care of religion? Are they antagonising it? What should they be doing? And judging by the various long tangents through which discussion meanders, the question certainly sparked our interest.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>If you have been listening to the podcast for the past couple of weeks, you will be aware that we are about to go on a brief hiatus until September, to give our listeners some time to catch up, and to give Chris and David a chance to catch up on some of their other commitments. The website will still be releasing content on a less regular basis, and we have at least one more roundtable discussion for your delectation over the coming weeks. We will also be re-releasing our &#8216;editors favourites&#8217; from the first batch of podcasts &#8211; so there will still be plenty of material to keep you occupied. However, before we &#8216;leave you&#8217; we wanted to go out with a bang, and it is therefore with pleasure that we present the second of our compilation episodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the first of our compilation episodes (<a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/03/19/podcast-what-is-the-future-of-religious-studies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What is the Future of Religious Studies?</a>), every time David, Chris and Jonathan have conducted an interview, they have been asking the interviewees an additional question: &#8216;Should Scholars of Religion be Critics or Caretakers?&#8217; The result is this compilation of differing opinions and interpretations of key terms from eight top scholars from a variety of disciplines—sociology, psychology, religious studies, theology—on how academics should position themselves in relation to the groups and individuals that they study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we decided to push things one step further with this one. The inspiration for this episode came from one of Russell McCutcheon&#8217;s works which we had encountered through the undergraduate Religious Studies programme at the University of Edinburgh, entitled <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Critics-Not-Caretakers-Redescribing-Religion/dp/0791449440\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion</a></em>. We thought it would be an excellent idea to invite Russell to respond to the opinions of the other scholars in this podcast, and are very grateful that not only was he happy to be involved, but he sent a ten minute response recording. Enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured in this podcast (with links to their previously released interviews):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a title=\"Podcast: Grace Davie on the Changing Nature of Religion\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/03/05/grace-davie-on-the-changing-face-of-religion/\">Professor Grace Davie</a>, University of Exeter</li><li>Dr Steven Sutcliffe, University of Edinburgh</li><li><a title=\"Podcast: Eileen Barker on Studying “Cults”\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/05/14/podcast-eileen-barker-on-studying-cults/\">Professor Eileen Barker,</a> London School of Economics</li><li><a title=\"Podcast: Linda Woodhead on the Secularisation Thesis\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/04/16/podcast-linda-woodhead-on-the-secularisation-thesis/\">Professor Linda Woodhead</a>, Lancaster University</li><li><a title=\"Podcast: Timothy Fitzgerald on ‘Religion’ and Mystification\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/06/04/podcast-timothy-fitzgerald-on-religion-and-mystification/\">Dr Timothy Fitzgerald</a>, University of Stirling</li><li>Dr Lois Lee, University of Cambridge/Goldsmiths, University of London</li><li><a title=\"Podcast: Jolyon Mitchell on Religion, Violence and the Media\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/05/07/podcast-jolyon-mitchell-on-religion-violence-and-the-media/\">Professor Jolyon Mitchell</a>, University of Edinburgh</li><li><a title=\"Podcast: Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi on Psychological Approaches to the Study of Religion\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/04/09/podcast-benjamin-beit-hallahmi-on-psychological-approaches-to-the-study-of-religion/\">Professor Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi</a>, University of Haifa</li><li>Professor Russell McCutcheon, University of Alabama</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these academics have already appeared on the <em>Religious Studies Project</em>, others’ interviews have yet to be released, and others&#8217; are still on our &#8216;to-do&#8217; list, yet each has their own unique perspective to offer, and we hope that you appreciate this compilation. We apologise for the UK-centric nature of these recordings&#8230; that&#8217;s just what happened in this instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you stick with us over the break, or come back to us in September, we can assure you that we have another great lineup in store.

This week we speak to another member of the Critical Religions group, Naomi Goldenberg, who presents the first of our theories on what religion is. In this interview Professor Goldenberg takes us through the idea that religions might be <em>vestigial states</em>. She argues that religions are formed in distinction to governmental &#8216;States&#8217; and represent the last vestiges of the previous order. At the same time this is a maneuver on the part of those States to delineate spheres of power. A vestigial state is both a once and future state, that which has gone and that which hopes to be. The idea of vestigial states throws into question our normal understanding of the term religion and Professor Goldenberg draws on such notable examples as the Islamic State, the Dalai Lama, Jewish history and even present day Wicca to illustrate the point. If you would like to know more about religions as vestigial states, Professor Goldenberg has also written on the topic on the <a href=\"http://www.criticalreligion.stir.ac.uk/author/naomigoldenberg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Critical Religions</a> website.</p>\n",

Goldenberg, who argues that religions are formed in distinction to governmental ‘States’ and represent the last vestiges of the previous order and explores several examples of this as well as considering the implications of this distinction.</p>\n",

Qualitative studies seek depth, typically based on interviews and observation with a relatively small pool of subjects.

So we decided we needed to speak to an acknowledged expert, to lay out the advantages &#8211; and deal with the issues &#8211; with quantitative data in the study of religions. In his interview, David Voas deals with the criticisms strongly and with good grace, while laying out a compelling case for the place of quantitative research in the contemporary study of religions.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_6357\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-1357-35\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP25-Voas.mp3?_=35\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP25-Voas.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP25-Voas.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP25-Voas.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=1357-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP25-Voas.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP25-Voas.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('1357-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_1357-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_1357-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_6358&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-1357-36&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP25-Voas.mp3?_=36&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP25-Voas.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP25-Voas.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-religious-studies-project/id495504655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

Each does different work, but each fundamentally acknowledges that what real people actually do on the ground, what they believe, what they identify with etc has a fundamentally greater impact upon religion as it exists in the real world than the discourses of theologians, philosophers and academics.

    "content": "<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion does not make man. Religion is indeed the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man, state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is therefore indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Religious distress is at the same time the expression of real distress and the protest against real distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is required for their real happiness. The demand to give up the illusion about its condition is the demand to give up a condition, which needs illusions.</em></p>\n<p>This famous quotation from German <span style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 26px;\">political</span><span style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 26px;\"> </span>philosopher Karl Marx&#8217;s unfinished <em><a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CGwQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marxists.org%2Farchive%2Fmarx%2Fworks%2Fdownload%2FMarx_Critique_of_Hegels_Philosophy_of_Right.pdf&amp;ei=6V7eT9HNIMuX8gPK-Li_Cw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFY5_wrz9WefYUnjeJCSqeri_wDmw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right</a></em> (1843) encapsulates his controversial and complex understanding of the social function of religion. It was a significant part of his theory of <em>alienation</em> &#8211; the worker was, in capitalist society, separated from their labour and its products; work had become outside of them, alien. Religion was part of the mechanism by which the bourgeois perpetuated this alienation and therefore the capitalist status quo. Life was unfair, but this was the price of entry into Heaven when you die. As Marx saw it, when the workers were no longer alienated from their work and society made equal, there would be no need for religion, and it would die away.</p>\n<p>The theory, and in particular the decontextualised soundbyte, &#8220;Religion is the opium of the masses&#8221;, was practically a matter of faith among the left-leaning liberal intelligentsia of the 60s and 70s, but the popularity of Marxist analyses of religion (and society in general) lost capital during the 80s and early 90s with the fall of the USSR and the Berlin Wall. What place, then, do his theories have in the contemporary academy, given society&#8217;s reawakened concern with inequality?

As Keysar&#8217;s data from a number of large-scale, quantitative studies shows, belief changes over time; it is situational, practical, functional, generational; it varies geographically; it varies across and within religious traditions; it has meaning outwith religion, and may be meaningless within; beliefs about the meaning of life may play very little role in daily life.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Listeners may be interested in the following excellent resources mentioned in the podcast which are freely available online:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Results of the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) 2008</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/publications/american-nones-the-profile-of-the-no-religion-population/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://prog.trincoll.edu/ISSSC/INDIAN_SURVEY_WEBSITE/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Survey, Worldviews and Opinions of Scientists: India 2007-08</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dr. Ariela Keysar, </strong>a demographer, is Associate Research Professor of Public Policy and Law and the Associate Director of the <a href=\"http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/isssc/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC)</a> at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut.

In this interview, Timothy Fitzgerald presents his critical deconstruction of religion as a powerful discourse and its parasitic relation to ‘secular’ categories such as politics and economics. Religion is not a stand-alone category, he argues; ‘religions’ are modern inventions which are made to appear ubiquitous and, by being removed to a marginal, privatised domain, serve to mystify the supposed natural rationality of the secular state and capital. Feminist deconstruction of gender categories shows how power constructions which serve male interests come to appear as natural and inevitable, a powerful analogy to the mystification of power relations by the modern invention of religious and secular domains.</p>\n<p><div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_6365\"><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-1261-43\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP21-Fitzgerald.mp3?_=43\" /><a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP21-Fitzgerald.mp3\">https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP21-Fitzgerald.mp3</a></audio></div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/p/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP21-Fitzgerald.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/?powerpress_pinw=1261-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window</a> | <a href=\"https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/s/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP21-Fitzgerald.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"RSP21-Fitzgerald.mp3\">Download</a> | <a href=\"#\" class=\"powerpress_link_e\" title=\"Embed\" onclick=\"return powerpress_show_embed('1261-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Embed</a></p><p class=\"powerpress_embed_box\" id=\"powerpress_embed_1261-podcast\" style=\"display: none;\"><input id=\"powerpress_embed_1261-podcast_t\" type=\"text\" value=\"&lt;div class=&quot;powerpress_player&quot; id=&quot;powerpress_player_6366&quot;&gt;&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;audio-1261-44&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP21-Fitzgerald.mp3?_=44&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP21-Fitzgerald.mp3&quot;&gt;https://media.blubrry.com/the_religious_studies_project/www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/RSP21-Fitzgerald.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\" onclick=\"javascript: this.select();\" onfocus=\"javascript: this.select();\" style=\"width: 70%;\" readOnly></p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcasts/feed/podcast/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS</a></p></p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-religious-studies-project/id495504655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTunes</a>.

We would be delighted if you used this as an opportunity to continue discussion of this important topic on our Facebook page, on Twitter, or in the comments section below.</p>\n<p>To continue the portrait of discussion&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ethan: &#8220;The issue with this issue that we are talking about is that there is no issue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As <a href=\"http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/culture/4636/why_the_world_needs_religious_studies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nathan Schneider recently wrote on Religion Dispatches</a>, &#8220;No matter what you “do with it,” really, the study of religion forces you to learn about geopolitics, languages, literatures, sciences, and histories.&#8221; Is this a good thing? Should individual scholars multi-disciplinary? Or just departments? What is the difference between multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kevin: &#8220;We don&#8217;t understand sociology as well as the sociologists; we don&#8217;t understand psychology as well as the psychologists&#8230; they might be able to give us information we can use in a way we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to gather.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Given that Religious Studies is currently vying for finances and for an academic identity and respect, is it important that we have one consistent methodological approach? Would this lead to commonality and manageability? Do we even need to be unique? Any why not turn to theory or content to provide that distinctiveness and autonomy?</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1221\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1221\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/md8-e1338367305594.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1221\" title=\"md8\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/md8-e1338367305594-300x240.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1221\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Liam: &#8220;A rough, minimal commitment to the social-scientific study of religion is all we really need to set us apart&#8230;&#8221;</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If we were to have just one methodology, what would it be? Phenomenology? Anthropology? Sociology? History? Psychology? Text Criticism? Neo-Tylorianism? Critical Religions? What would we &#8220;kick out&#8221;?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Towards the end of the discussion, the issues of bias and representation come to the fore. which is quite serendipitous given that our next compilation episode and roundtable are both focusing on the issue of whether scholars of religion should be critics or caretakers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There is a lot of chat about <a title=\"Podcast: Callum Brown on Historical Approaches to (Losing) Religion\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/04/30/podcast-callum-brown-on-historical-approaches-to-losing-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">historical approaches</a> in this podcast, and if you would like to get a better handle on what this mysterious phenomenology actually is, then please do listen to <a title=\"Podcast: James Cox on the Phenomenology of Religion\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/01/14/podcast-james-cox-on-the-phenomenology-of-religion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this podcast with the oft-mentioned James Cox</a>, or read <a title=\"Jonathan Tuckett: What is Phenomenology?\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/01/20/jonathan-tuckett-what-is-phenomenology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jonathan&#8217;s response essay</a> on the same topic.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1235\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1235\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/md6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1235 \" title=\"md6\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/md6-e1338367829336-300x272.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/md6-e1338367829336-300x272.jpg 300w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/md6-e1338367829336-1024x929.jpg 1024w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/md6-e1338367829336.jpg 1388w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1235\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maegan: &#8220;I think you originally asked a question, but did you just answer it yourself?&#8221;</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><strong>The Panelists:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Krittika.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-1215\" title=\"Krittika\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Krittika-252x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"151\" height=\"180\" /></a>Krittika Bhattacharjee is reading towards an MSc in Religious Studies at the University of Edinburgh.

    "content": "\n<p>Although &#8220;cult&#8221; and &#8220;sect&#8221; are used as technical terms in religious studies, in their popular usage, &#8220;cult&#8221; tends to refer to a New Religious Movement [NRM] or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered reprehensible. Since such pejorative attitudes are generally considered inappropriate for the academic study of religion, scholars have tended to adopt the nomenclature of NRMs to refer to &#8220;a wide range of groups and movements of alternative spirituality, the emergence of which is generally associated with the aftermath of the 1960s counter-culture&#8221; (Arweck 2002:269). In this interview with Chris, Emeritus Professor Eileen Barker (LSE) takes us through the academic study of NRMs from the 1960s onwards, engaging with the particular challenges and successes which have been encountered by academics in the field, and reflecting on some of the more colourful aspects of this area of research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/e.barker@lse.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eileen Barker</a> OBE, FBA, is Emeritus Professor of Sociology with special reference to the study of Religion at the London School of Economics.

She has over&nbsp;300 publications, translated into 27 languages. She travels extensively for research purposes, particularly in North America, Europe and Japan, and, since collapse of the Berlin Wall, in Eastern Europe and, more recently, China.

What is an alternative to a social scientific approach?  These questions and more form the basis for what we intend to act as a bridge between our previous roundtable (“<a title=\"Roundtable: What is the Future of Religious Studies?\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/03/21/roundtable-what-is-the-future-of-religious-studies/\">What is the Future of Religious Studies?</a>”) and our forthcoming roundtable (“Should scholars of religion be critics or caretakers?”), timetabled for release on 6 June 2012.</p>\n<p>Discussion largely focussed upon Quantitative Methods… something which future podcasts with Ariela Keysar and David Voas shall be focusing on more explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do social scientists depend upon assumptive reasoning when it comes to filling in the blanks in their data? Does a decline in church attendance mean a decline in conviction, or simply a decline in one’s attendance at church? By providing boxes do we force people into boxes? What does one individual tell us about a category? What is it specifically about religion that makes this such an issue? How do we trust people to answer in a certain way?</p></blockquote>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1072\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1072\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMGP0740.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1072 \" title=\"IMGP0740\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMGP0740-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMGP0740-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMGP0740-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMGP0740.jpg 1728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin: “Aren’t you better hypothesising by going out and asking people questions than by sitting around and hypothesising?”</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Reference is made to the <a href=\"http://davidgrobertson.wordpress.com/\">panel session</a> on Religious Conspiracies at which David, Kevin and Ethan had presented earlier in the day.

    "title": "The Secularisation Thesis",
    "content": "\n<p>The secularisation thesis—the idea that traditional religions are in terminal decline in the industrialised world—was perhaps the central debate in the sociology of religion in the second half of the 20th century. Scholars such as Steve Bruce, Rodney Stark, and Charles Taylor argued whether religion was becoming less important to individuals, or that only the authority of religions in the public sphere was declining. Data from the US and South America, however, began to challenge many of their basic assumptions. Professor Linda Woodhead joins us to discuss the background and legacy of the secularisation thesis. <br><br>A transcription of this interview is also <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Woodhead-Secularization1.2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">available as a PDF</a>.</p>\n",

How does a religion constructed from the fictional Star Wars universe problematise how we conceptualise other religions, and the stories they involve? &nbsp;And what makes certain stories able to transcend their fictional origins and become myths?</p>\n<p>Markus Altena Davidsen is a PhD candidate at the universities of Aarhus, Denmark and Leiden, Netherlands, and assistant lecturer in the sociology of religion in Leiden.&nbsp;Since 2009, he has been working on a PhD project entitled “Fiction-based Religions: The Use of Fiction in Contemporary Religious Bricolage”. In this project, Davidsen attempts to do three things. Firstly, he maps the various ways on which religious groups since the 1960s have been integrating elements from Tolkien’s literary mythology with beliefs and practices from more established religious traditions. This material is used to develop a typology of forms of religious bricolage (harmonising, domesticating, archetypal etc.) which are also at work in alternative spirituality in general. Secondly, he looks at how Tolkien religionists legitimise their religious practice (to themselves and others) given that it is based on a work of fiction. These accounts are compared with what cognitive theory has to say about&nbsp;narratives and plausibility construction. Thirdly, Davidsen treats how the internet has facilitated the emergence of a self-conscious spiritual Tolkien milieu. Some preliminary conclusions from the project are presented in the forthcoming article “The Spiritual Milieu Based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s Literary Mythology”, in Adam Possamai (ed.), <em>Handbook of Hyper-real Religions</em>, in the series Brill <em>Handbooks on Contemporary Religion</em> 5, Leiden &amp; Boston: Brill, 185-204.</p>\n<p>You can keep up with Markus&#8217;s work on <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/01/30/podcast-carole-cusack-on-invented-religions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Invented Religions</a>.

It is in understanding that variousness – its range, its nature, its basis, and its implications – that we shall come to construct a concept of human nature that, more than a statistical shadow, and less than a primitivists dream, has both substance and truth.” (Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures, 1973:52)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p align=\"left\">This quotation from Clifford Geertz, one of the canonical figures in anthropology, succinctly sums up what anthropology tries to do. Anthropology is essentially a comparative study of socio-cultural behaviour and attitudes, and is one of the most complex yet fundamental tools in the scholar of religions’ toolbox.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Some scholars make a career out of being an anthropologist of religion, others employ the techniques of ethnographic fieldwork in combination with other approaches and methodologies. And, of course, even those scholars who are attempting to be solely anthropologists of religion cannot divorce religion from the host of other contextual factors within which they believe they have found it. This week, David (and, briefly, Chris) are joined by Dr Bettina Schmidt of the University of Wales, Trinity St David, who gives an insightful personal account of the complex task of conducting anthropological fieldwork, with examples from a variety of contexts.</p>\n<p>You can also download this interview, and subscribe to receive our weekly podcast, on <a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bettina_schmidt.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-897\" title=\"bettina_schmidt\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bettina_schmidt-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/02/20/podcast-george-chryssides-on-the-insideroutsider-problem/\">The Insider/Outsider Problem</a>, and/or reading Katie Aston&#8217;s response <a title=\"Katie Aston: Insider and Outsider – An Anthropological Perspective\" href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2012/02/24/katie-aston-insider-and-outsider-an-anthropological-perspective/\">Insider and Outsider &#8211; An Anthropological Perspective</a>. Anthropology is a complex beast, and something which can only truly be learned in the field. As our friend Damon Zacharias Lycourinos has said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Anthropology is the art and science of taking paradigms of ethnography from your supervisor, taking them into the field, realising that they are wrong due to their objectivity, re-shaping and introducing a new school of anthropological theory, and expecting your re-shaped paradigms to be annihilated by your future students.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n",

In the current economic climate &#8211; particularly in the UK &#8211; and with the increasing commodification of the Higher Education sector. It is no longer acceptable for academics to sit pontificating in their ivory towers, and <em>every</em> discipline (but particularly Religious Studies) is finding itself increasingly in the firing line in terms of funding and resources. This issue is so pressing that the British Association for the Study of Religions (BASR) and the British Sociological Association&#8217;s Sociology of Religion Study Group (SOCREL) &#8211; the two professional organisations that together represent the UK’s leading scholars in the study of religion &#8211; have joined forces to present a joint panel on ‘Public benefit in the study of religion’ at the BASR annual conference, September 5-7 2012 University of Winchester, UK.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/what-is-the-future-of-RS21.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-853\" title=\"what-is-the-future-of-RS2\" src=\"https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/what-is-the-future-of-RS21.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"></a>However, this is not the only issue on the table.

From this perspective, religion can be considered one of a number of potential sources of the sacred.</p>\n<p>Jay Demerath is currently the Emile Durkheim Distinguished Professor of Sociology Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where he has been a faculty member since 1972, including ten years as Chair. Prior to UMass, he received a 1958 A.B. from Harvard and a 1964 Ph.D from the U.

Among his many publications, he is author or editor of fourteen books, including the award-winning Crossing the Gods: World Religions and Worldly Politics (2001) and the recent Sage Handbook for the Sociology of Religion (2008). The current Chair-elect of the Religion Section of the American Sociological Association, he is also past-President of the Eastern Sociological Society, the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, and the Association for the Sociology of Religion.</p>\n<p>Of particular relevance to this interview is his paper from 2000, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0021-8294.00001/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Varieties of Sacred Experience: Finding the Sacred in a Secular Grove</a>, from the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 39, p. 1–11<span style=\"line-height: 25px;\">. Here&#8217;s the abstract:</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">This paper contends that the social scientific study of religion has long labored under a chafing constraint and a misleading premise. It suggests that our primary focus should be on the sacred, and that religion is just one among many possible sources of the sacred. Defining religion “substantively” but the sacred “functionally” helps toresolve a long-standing tension in the field. Broadened conceptions of the sacred and of “sacralization” help to defuse the conflict among the two very different versions of secularization theory: the “all-or-nothing” versus the “middle range.” Meanwhile, a conceptual typology of the sacred pivots around the intersections of two distinctions (compensatory vs. confirmatory and marginal vs. institutional). This generates four distinct scenarios: the sacred as integrative, the sacred as quest, the sacred as collectivity, and the sacred as counter-culture. The paper concludes with three admonitions for research in the area.</p>\n",

In the 1960s, most sociologists consciously or unconsciously bought into idea of the &#8216;death of god&#8217; &#8211; religion became effectively invisible to academia. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, a number of events &#8211; most notably <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses_controversy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the &#8216;Satanic Verses&#8217; controversy</a> &#8211; dramatically increased the &#8216;visibility&#8217; of religion: it became a political <em>problem</em>. Now, in the 21st century, religion is increasingly being construed by politicians, educators, the media etc, as a useful resource to be exploited. These public perceptions are but one facet of the way in which &#8216;religion&#8217; can be understood as &#8216;changing&#8217;.</p>\n<p>In this interview with Chris, Professor Davie discusses the place of religion in modern Europe, paying particular attention to the place of the United Kingdom within the European context. In an effort to combat the caricatures that typify media accounts of religion in the contemporary world, Davie discusses the changing nature of religion, in academia and in the public square, and considers the impact of the arrival of new cultures into Europe, whilst reflecting on secular reactions to these.</p>\n<p>Three freely accessible articles by Prof. Davie which should be of interest to our listeners are &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.thearda.com/rrh/papers/guidingpapers/Davie.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thinking Sociologically about Religion: A Step Change in the Debate?</a>&#8220;, published by The ARDA in 2011,&nbsp; &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.iasc-culture.org/HHR_Archives/AfterSecularization/8.12DDavie.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Is Europe an Exceptional Case?</a>&#8221; from The Hedgehog Review (2006), and &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.kent.ac.uk/religionmethods/topics/comparative-research.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Working Comparatively</a>&#8221; from the University of Kent&#8217;s Research Methods for the Study of Religion website.</p>\n<p>This interview was recorded in October 2011 in Milwaukee, WI at the annual meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.sssrweb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Society for the Scientific Study of Religion</a>.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Our interview this week features Chris speaking to Professor <a href=\"http://www.religion.utoronto.ca/people/cross-appointed-faculty/donald-wiebe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Donald Wiebe</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.trinity.utoronto.ca/Faculty_of_Divinity/Faculty_Staff.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Faculty of Divinity at Trinity College in the University of Toronto</a> on the relationship between Theology and Religious Studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Ed. note. Out of necessity this interview was not recorded on our normal equipment, and we apologise for the poorer quality of the sound this week. </em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The relationship between Theology and Religious Studies&nbsp; is not a simple one. David Ford writes that at its broadest, theology is thinking about questions raised by and about religions (2000:3). These questions are largely directed towards notions of transcendence (typically gods), incorporate doctrinal issues and are “essentially a second-order activity arising from ‘faith’ and interpreting faith” (Whaling, 1999:228-229). Essentially, theology is thinking about religion from within religion &#8211; although when most people refer to &#8220;Theology&#8221;, what they mean is &#8220;Christian Theology&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is generally accepted—at least as far as most academics are concerned—that there is a distinct difference between religious studies and theology. This is succinctly summarised by Ninian Smart’s statement that “historical and structural enquiries, such as sociology, phenomenology, etc., [&#8230;] are the proper province of [the study of] Religion, and the use of such materials for Expressive ends [&#8230;is] the doing of Theology” (in Wiebe, 1999:55).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you shall see from this interview, however, things are much more complicated, and Professor Wiebe is particularly qualified to present his own take on the relationship between these two distinct disciplines. His primary areas of research interest are philosophy of the social sciences, epistemology, philosophy of religion, the history of the academic and scientific study of religion, and method and theory in the study of religion. He is the author of a number of books, including <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cruaSZ56pYkC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=LsimYXOoYf&amp;dq=Religion%20and%20Truth%3A%20Towards%20an%20Alternative%20Paradigm%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Religion&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Religion%20and%20Truth:%20Towards%20an%20Alternative%20Paradigm%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Religion&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Religion and Truth: Towards and Alternative Paradigm for the Study of Religion</em></a> (1981), <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TA0XNACjnd0C&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=FDEaJVB9dx&amp;dq=The%20Irony%20of%20Theology%20and%20the%20Nature%20of%20Religious%20Thought&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Irony%20of%20Theology%20and%20the%20Nature%20of%20Religious%20Thought&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Irony of Theology and the Nature of Religious Thought</em></a> (1991), and, of particular relevance to this interview, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Politics-Religious-Studies-Donald-Wiebe/dp/0312238886\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Politics of Religious Studies: The Continuing Conflict with Theology in the Academy</em></a> (1999).

Cusack (Associate Professor in Studies in Religion at the University of Sydney) answers these questions and more, exploring her notion of “Invented Religions” and introducing the listener to a wide variety of contemporary and unusual forms of religion. Discussion flows through a range of topics – from Discordianism and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster to Scientology, Jediism and the New Atheism – and demonstrates how the works of authors such as Thomas Pynchon and Robert A. Heinlein can be transformed by others and take on a life of their own.
