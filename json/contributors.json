He lived in the &#8216;bush&#8217; with a school centre connected to the mission station (it is still extant). In this environment he sensed a lot of the Pagan and shamanistic traditions alive in the traditionalist setting. His parents respected these things because on his mother&#8217;s side was a rural diviner / spiritual healer in the early 20th century, in southern Germany. Later he studied theology and science of religion as well as psychology in Germany. After years of professional life as a pastor and then in academia and upper secondary (grammar school/college) education, he returned to academic research. He did research on the Afro-Brazilian branch of the Bantu shamanistic tradition, in Umbanda, into which he has been initiated, through a community in Switzerland. Increasingly he went back to the sources and did research on Bantu shamanism in South Africa. Dr. Kleinhempel’s many publications include the study of Bantu Shamanism and in African Traditional Religion are enmeshed with the other pursuits: of Orthodox spirituality and theology, Esotericism and Syncretism studies.

Her research is positioned at the intersection of theology, sociology and the social scientific study of religion and combines a wide array of issues related to consumption, care, welfare and ethics. Food has been a persistent theme in her academic work. In her doctoral dissertation and in related publications, she has studied food consumption mainly in the context of poverty and deprivation. Recently, she has moved further with this research interest by focusing on food excess and affluence in addition to scarcity, yet acknowledging that these are not separate issues but rather two sides of the same coin. In her current research project, she explores the content and construction of ethical lives of ordinary people by asking what they consider to be moderate with regards to food consumption and by analyzing how they construct these views. Understanding the ethics of ordinary food consumption is essential in a society where food system routinely produces more food than we are able to consume and where people are constantly invited to exhibit their identity, personality and values through food choices.</p>\n<p>Her recent publications include the following:<br />\nSalonen Anna Sofia, Ohisalo Maria, Laihiala Tuomo (2018) Undeserving, disadvantaged, disregarded: Three viewpoints of charity food aid recipients in Finland.

Dr. Bassett argues that the Nahuatl term “teotl” carried a set of five culturally dependent denotations.

In addition, this interpretation of the religious interactions between Western Europe and the ‘East’ revealed attitudes towards religion in contemporary western societies and contributed to a sociological understanding of processes of globalisation.</p>\n<p>Her interest in cultural and religious diversity is also reflected in her interest in another research field: the sociological analysis of anti-Semitism.

During the course of that degree, I became interested in the way that art functioned to transmit and enforce unspoken assumptions about the order of the world—assumptions that were largely, though not exclusively, rooted in religious thinking. I carried this interest forward into an MA focused on Religious Studies and Literature, and a PhD in Literature, Theology and the Arts, in which I examined various ways that religion both influences and is influenced by cultural production in literature and the visual arts.</p>\n<p>Prior to joining the staff at Chester in October 2012, I held posts as the Barbro Osher Research Fellow in Memory of Krister Stendahl at the Swedish Theological Institute in Jerusalem, and as a Rothschild Fellow in Jewish Studies at the University of Glasgow.

My master’s dissertation explored how perceptions of the pastoral needs of women during the twentieth century tended to stereotype them as wives and mothers. For my PhD, I studied the impact of gender theory on the discipline of pastoral studies within the Western Christian tradition.</p>\n<p>From there, via an interest in religion and the body, I started to think about the ways in which popular culture and scientific discourses provide the Western cultural imagination with all sorts of depictions of what it means to be human in a digital, biotechnological and cybernetic age. That interest continues in my work on media, culture and religion.</p>\n<p>I have also contributed to the field of practical theology through my work with Heather Walton and Frances Ward on theological reflection.</p>\n<p>I’m also interested in the political and public dimensions of religion: my work in urban theology has tried to bring traditions of Christian social thought to bear on the question, What Makes a Good City? More recently, I’ve been thinking about how the Church can better communicate its contribution to society at a time when there is renewed interest in religion as a global cultural force but an enduring scepticism as to the legitimacy of religious voices in public.

His academic studies of religion developed in two streams namely Oriental Studies in Sri Lanka (1994-2000) and then Religious Studies in Canada (2003-2011). While the former acquainted him with texts associated with Buddhism and Hinduism, the latter contributed to his understanding of their colourful expressions in historical settings such as Sri Lanka and India as well as in the diaspora (i.e., North America). Mitra completed his PhD in Religious Studies at Wilfrid Laurier University in 2011. His doctoral research examined the reconfiguration of Sri Lankan Buddhism in three historical periods namely colonial Ceylon, postcolonial Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan Buddhist diaspora particularly in Toronto, Canada. He is currently transforming his dissertation into a monograph, provisionally entitled <i>Weaving Ola and Maple Leaves Together: Sri Lankan Buddhists in Toronto</i> (under a contract to Wilfrid Laurier Press, Waterloo, Canada).</p>\n<p>Mitra’s research explores the nature and functions of Theravada Buddhism in a minority context, an unexplored research perspective in Theravada studies. Mitra thinks that how Buddhism is perceived and practiced within a minority context noticeably differs from its majority counterpart. As such, he examines contemporary Theravada Buddhism in two distinct locations i.e., North America and the Bengal regions in India and Bangladesh, where Buddhism functions as a minority religion. Mitra is fluent in Bengali and Sinhalese and possess a working knowledge of Lao. These vernacular languages enrich his historical and ethnographic research. He also possesses degree-level competencies in the classical languages of Pali and Sanskrit that enable him to read and understand texts in South Asian religions.</p>\n<h3>Selected Publications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>(Co-authored with Mavis Fenn, University of Waterloo) “Community.” In <i>World of Buddhism, </i>edited by John Powers and Charles Prebish.

In this project, Davidsen attempts to do three things. Firstly, he maps the various ways on which religious groups since the 1960s have been integrating elements from Tolkien’s literary mythology with beliefs and practices from more established religious traditions. This material is used to develop a typology of forms of religious bricolage (harmonising, domesticating, archetypal etc.) which are also at work in alternative spirituality in general. Secondly, he looks at how Tolkien religionists legitimise their religious practice (to themselves and others) given that it is based on a work of fiction. These accounts are compared with what cognitive theory has to say about&nbsp;narratives and plausibility construction. Thirdly, Davidsen treats how the internet has facilitated the emergence of a self-conscious spiritual Tolkien milieu. Some preliminary conclusions from the project are presented in the forthcoming article “The Spiritual Milieu Based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s Literary Mythology”, in Adam Possamai (ed.),&nbsp;<em>Handbook of Hyper-real Religions</em>, in the series Brill&nbsp;<em>Handbooks on Contemporary Religion</em>&nbsp;5, Leiden &amp; Boston: Brill, 185-204.&nbsp;You can keep up with Markus&#8217;s work on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://leidenuniv.academia.edu/MarkusDavidsen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his Academia page</a></p>\n",

His thesis–<em>Religion-Related Discourse: A Critical Approach to Non-Religion in Edinburgh’s Southside</em>–focused upon the discourses on ‘religion’ in the Southside of Edinburgh, the concepts of ‘non-religion’ and ‘the secular’, and the ensuing critical and theoretical implications for Religious Studies. His previous degrees at the University of Edinburgh focused upon ‘New Atheism’ and alternative typologies of ‘non-religion’. His wider interests include New Religious Movements, qualitative methods, discourse analysis, spatial approaches, critical theory, and Religious Studies as a discipline. After these periods of study, he was Leverhulme Early Career Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh (2017-2020), Lecturer in Religious Studies at the University of Chester (2020-2021), IASH-CTPI Duncan Forrester Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, University of Edinburgh (2020-2021), and Teaching Fellow in Anthropology and Sociology of Religions at the University of Edinburgh (2021).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris is also Honorary Treasurer of the <a href=\"https://basr.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">British Association for the Study of Religions</a> and an advisory board member the <a href=\"https://thensrn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nonreligion and Secularity Research Network</a>.
